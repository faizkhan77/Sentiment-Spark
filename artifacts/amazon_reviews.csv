"iBOLT xProDock Active Car Dock/Holder/Mount for Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 & Note 2 fits my  galaxy S4 perfectly. I had to reverse where the charging cable went so that I was not hiding the volume button but other then that it was good. It is very sturdy and works as good as the Motorola Nav Dock I had for my Droid Razr. The view from the camera is unobstructed. The software that you down load works OK. I was used to Motorola Drive app but this has just as much functionality. You can program it to toggle Bluetooth and all that."
"This pouch is everything that I was looking for. I have an Otter box commuter case around my Samsung S3 and it fits perfectly inside the pouch, as a matter of fact it is really snug, and I like it. The flap's magnets on the other hand are not very strong or as strong as the should be, but nevertheless the flap does stay closed.Overall a very good product at a very good price."
"First of all - the case I had on my iPhone 4 previously was one of the free ones they give you to alleviate the signal loss issue. I like this one much more. It's a little bit thicker, though not too thick to slide in and out of my pocket. It's a little loose around the sides which can be a bit annoying since it puffs out slightly on either side making it seem like the phone doesn't quite fit snugly enough, but I haven't had any problems with the case slipping off the phone. I mostly like the design - the cutout in the back allows the Apple symbol to show through, which I appreciate, but the hole on the side of the volume buttons is a bit too big. The case I previously had covered those buttons but labeled them on the outside of the case and let you push the buttons through the case. I feel like exposing the buttons exposes the phone unnecessarily. Everything else is fine and I like the neutral black color and the circular design, though I wouldn't mind if ""amazon basics"" weren't embedded in the bottom of the back of the case. I think it would look nicer with no label."
I ordered this case because I had the same case for my HTC Inspire and that case lasted 3 years with absolutely no issues. It outlasted the phone! This is Otterbox quality without the bulk and at a better price.
Bought a few of these as gifts. They were a big hit.  They loved the choice of colors. Made their devices more personalized. Easy to apply. Could not beat the price.
"This is a must have for any wanna be photographer! I love the micro lens, it takes such great detailed pictures. The fish lens is nice too. Just make sure you buy the right one. If you have a 4s make sure this is for the 4s because the metal piece only fits the 4s, not the4."
"thanks. I think this is the best choise what I see, OTG Adapter Dongle Cable 30Pin To Female USB Samsung Galaxy Tab..."
"Works great and at a great price, I love Apple and cant wait to upgrademy phone to a 5."
"Fits well on the Atrix 2.  Atrix 2 has some complicated beveled glass, so these guys gut the cover short to compensate - well done. Application was very easy, no bubbles and stays on the phone.  Been on the phone for about 6 weeks, in pocket the screen guard does show a little wear (minor scratching) but nothing too unsightly.  I would buy again, nice price for 5 laser gut screen protectors."
"Long cable permits charging your device from a long distance. I had purchased this product before and unfortunately it broke, but I was lucky to find the exact same one!"
This is a good case.  It fits perfectly and looks great.  The only complaint is tha the side covers should have been silver like the phone instead of white.
"I am a heavy user of bluetooth headsets. Use the headsets extensively (several hours/day) for work and whenever talking while driving.  I've have tested many bluetooth headsets and currently use thePlantronics Voyager Proheadset.This headset meets and passes my primary requirement... the microphone and speaker quality is good.  Hard to believe how many other headsets can't live up to the basic requirement for microphone/speaker quality.Other notable shining points... the headset fits my ear and is comfortable (once I figured out the process for putting it on, very different than my current headset), the volume is good, I very much like the folding boom to turn off the headset for carrying in my pocket (massive positive that you don't get butt dials this way).  Also, when charging, it is very clear when it is done.Because of the positives, this headset enters the limited category of 2 headsets that I can live with (out of many that I have tried)... this one (the Jabra Motion) and the Plantronics Voyager.I gave the Jabra Motion 4 stars because there are some notable areas for improvement (and didn't give it 3 stars because, even with the annoyances, this is a nice headset... it's just that it can be so much better).Concerns:- Glitches waking up.  While using the headset, if leaving it in my ear without turning it off (folding the boom), it seems to go to sleep.  If I receive a call... it doesn't always wake up properly and answer the call.  I am forced to fold and unfold the boom to reliably pick up a call on my iPhone 4s.- The button on the headset to pickup/hangup/redial is very easy to bump when adjusting the headset in my ear.  I got tired of thinking ""arrrgh, I did it again"" when adjusting the headset- Volume control is gimmicky.  It is a touch sensor that I did not like at all.  My hair would constantly get it the way of using it.- Mobile app for the phone... limited use, waste of time.  Nothing worse than an app the provides almost no value.Missed Opportunity with the Mobile App:I think Jabra missed an great opportunity with their mobile app for the headset.  The limited use functionality that it has is a waste of time to spend downloading.  However, the opportunity is to add the ability to tweak all kinds of features I would love love LOVE to be able to tweak... for example.  Turn off double-click re-dialing.  That feature is a bane for me... hate it in all headsets and would like it to go away.  So, set a feature in the app to default to it on and let me undo it.  Same thing for other features... give me the ability to set a default power-up volume.  So, if I adjust the volume in a noisy or quiet environment, and later use the headset, it goes back to what I want it to be.  I'm sure with a little thought, a whole slew of options would come to light.  Develop an app that improves my use of this product... be a differentiator versus the waste of time that it is now."
"Good looking, grat quality. Beats buying an Otter. Case is not as hard as Otter. Feels nicer to the touch."
"Good case but my Galaxy Nexus will hardly fit, have to push to make it fit.  But otherwise a nice case, except for that ugly decorative clip on the front."
"Sound quality 7/10Construction 5/10Materials 4/10They sound good but if whatever app you are using has an equalizer that helps...nothing new there. They are not put together very well. I bought a few of these and a couple of them had bad wire connections on the left speaker. The insulation on the wires is not very tough either. Also the rubber ear pieces come off rather easily if they get pulled from your ears. I am a painter and my girlfriend says I am hard on earphones anyway. I listen to them at work, shopping or driving because I like audiobooks. I can answer calls with them and control my audiobook player. One thing that surprised me with these is the ability for my girfriend to here me when I am driving the truck with the windows down. The only thing I have found that works better than these is my Blue Parrot headset. You could carry on a conversation in a concert with that on."
"She could not believe her eyes when I gave it to her.  I have never liked pink even when I was a little girl, I always loved the primary colors.  But....my friend LOVES PINK, so I got it for her.  When we are out, I have my red phone and she has her pink phone.  Buy it, it is BEAUTIFUL."
"It seems like all of the devices I carry with me when I travel require either a Micro USB, 30-Pin or Lightning connection.  I have a recharge kit in my laptop bag that has a USB battery pack, retractible micro USB cable, this adapter and a Micro USB to Lightning adapter in a small drawstring bag.  With those small items, I can recharge pretty much anything I need (except my laptop.)  These are the contents of my kit as product links:-Alpatronix PX500 5000mAh Portable External Power Bank and Extended USB Battery Backup Charger Pack for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, 3GS, 3G, iPad 4, 3, 2, 1, mini, iPod touch, nano, shuffle, Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2, Ace, HTC One, Evo, Thunderbolt, Incredi...-HTC EVO 4G wiried Gomadic compact and retractable USB Charge cable - a USB Power Port Ready design and uses TipExchange- Apple Lightning to Micro USB Adapter- Lenmar CAMCTOAP Micro USB to 30-Pin AdapterOne nice bonus feature of this product is it has a little loop that you could clip something like aCell Phone Strap Black/ Silver Tone Split Ring (10)to.With so many adapters out there that don't work, the biggest thing you can say about this is that it works!"
"I am always scratching my screen protectors, so I've kinda got the hang of applying them, but the Tylt ALIN is a great product. With three easy steps you can have a perfect ALINment of your screen protector. It's really as easy as inserting your clean device, putting on the protector, and pushing out the bubbles. Very very recommended to any iPhone 5 (or 5S - worked great on both) user!!! Maybe even 5C, but you may not be able to fit your phone in!)"
I lost my old charger and this works great for any Samsung phone.  Can't be the price too. Might have to get a couple more for road trips.
"I need these little things for my jump drive. It had a tiny tiny slot in it for a strap. This works, but because its so small it breaks easily. I guess I should have know that from the get go. They need to make some of these out of woven Kevlar or something!! anyone out there??!!"
"I absolutely love this case! I gave it a 5 out of 5 because it does everything it is suppose to. It covers my back, my corners, i have already dropped my s3 with this case on and it saved my front because it protects the front glass as well because it gives it a slight raise of the flat surface. The red one is a nice color only if you have a Garnet red , in my opinion."
"Very good fitting case, as usual, by Incipio.  This offers very solid protection to the device, and some style.  It is a tad bulky, but that added bulk does give you piece of mind."
"I really liked this product, the look and feel of it was great for the first week.  After that there were some tiny air bubbles that started to form near one of the corners and that was the end of this protector.  Dirt and lint started forming were the corner had lifted up and I could not stand the look of my iPhone with it on there, so I removed it.  I could have replaced it, but reading the other reviews I knew that it was just going to happen again."
My father in law loves this. I got a new car with bluetooth (honda civic) and I loved the handsfree dialing and calling feature. I thought this would make a great gift for someone without that feature and I was right. I guess you do have to click the button so it is not completely handfree but it works great.
"I had a couple of bluetooth and this by far is the best i had. I recommend this, especially for first time users."
"These were cute and have a nice, soft tip.  The stones shine and they will make nice gifts.  They also came in a timely fashion."
Cover doesn't cover the corners like I wanted. But it is so pretty that I still use it once in a while when I know I won't drop my phone.
"Item described as a Samsung note 2 replacement s pen, However received original Samsung note S -pen. But at least it was Marble White ;-)But you guessed it - doesn't even fit my phone.However company refunded all payment in full including shipping, excellent service on this front! However disappointed on poor product description! Need to advertise correctly -- Hello Marketing 101!"
I don't think this is a new battery but it did its job in helping me get my contacts out of an old phone came with someone of a charge I was also able to get all my pictures so for the price and quality it did its job
THIS COVER FITS MY PHONE PERFECT I LIKE THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS  AND OPTIONS FOR MY CELL PHONE.  I LIKE TO MATCH MY OUTFITS.
"I thought that it would be good, but I really can't put in my pocket easily. I still need some type of holder on the side since I am a guy. the card holders are neat for credit cards or IDs, but it still doesn't fit in my pocket easily."
"This is by far the best cigar lighter power supply available.  It's built very well and the 3M tape securs it securly to the side of the transmission shifter.  Also, it plugs in quite unobtrusively, too.  You won't go wrong with this item."
Holy cow now when my phone goes dead I can switch right over to my back up power and be back up talking in no time top notch product plus it comes with different color cases so you may pick your favorite one could not of asked for a better product
"I have had so many problems with this phone.  The blue tooth is un-predictable.  Sometimes it connects and other times is is OK.  When on a call, the screen blanks out and it is so hard to pull up the dial pad to enter numbers.  It makes it difficult to get the screen to come up to change the speaker phone selection.  When adding to my cars blue tooth, the phone book will not download.  Other devices I use work great."
"Really helpful, actually this adapter is somewhat an all around gadget it will work on Samsung, Motorola, and a Kyocera cellphones. Nice price too!!!"
"this case is a little bit thicker than most TPU cases, which doesnt lend its self to the fact that the only reason you would ever buy this case, is to protect your phone with a Goliath sized battery hulking out of it. like most TPU products, this is an ungodly fingerprint magnet. The interior of the case is matte finished which looks really nice and is oily residue resistant. I would happily rebuy this case if they flipped it inside out and used the matte side as the exterior. (hint hint!!!)GOOD:-That it exists-durable yet cheapBAD:- Not a perfect fit and a little loose on the sides- The volume buttons are now too sensative to touch- the micro usb port need a bigger cut out to keepevery charger i tried from unnoticeably sliding out- needs MATTE FINISH on the outside of case to preventsmudges and unsightly fingerprints."
"This is a really nice little Bluetooth ear bud.  It's light enough to simply fit in your ear, with a couple different sized ear pieces and an over-the-ear adapter if you need a more secure attachment.  We paired it with both an HTC Touch Pro and Motorola Droid and the process was easy and straight forward.  The cool thing is that it can be used with two different phones without re-pairing.  Sound quality was great on both ends.  One feature I was very pleasantly surprised with was the voice control and feedback.  Many phones have voice control, and this phone will work with those systems, but the phone has voice control on its own to give connection and battery status and other handy thing.  One command, ""Call Information"", calls Bing 411, which was pretty cool."
"I bought two of these.  They both work and are 6 feet long.  I gave it 4 stars because the first couple of times I plugged in an Ipad2 or my Iphone-4s, it didn't start charging.  Had to unplug and replug it in."
"This is a universal tablet holder for automobile headrests.Quality: This product is very well made. All the pieces are thick, well designed and padded in the right places. This is not a flimsy piece of hardware.- Tablet holder has nonslip padding anywhere that touches the tablet.- Tablet is locked into place by snap lever in the back.- Viewing angle of the tablet can be adjusted by a 360 degree ball joint.- Headrest attachments are secured by oversized thumb screws.It's easily adjustable and it will accept anything as big as a tad under 8 inches and anything as small as 4 1/4 inches. The max thickness of anything that will fit in the clamps is about 5/8 of an inch.Testing on two different headrest shows that it holds the tablet well without slippage, works as advertised.But the real gem we found is that this holder works just as well as a tablet holder at home. It can hold the tablet upright or sideways and you can either hold it at a high angle or low angle depending on how you put the holder. Just put your tablet in it and set it on the table and voila, a tablet stand.Overall a high quality headrest tablet holder that can also be used as a tablet stand. Made of thick sturdy plastic. Sample was received for review purposes."
"Excellent fit, great materials, has inner soft lining to prevent  iphone 5 from scratching. It provides the protection my iphone needs and it looks and feels way above my expectations. The slider case is ultra thin and lightweight, so it almost feels like there is nothing there, but if you drop it, you know its well protected on every corner. Thanks for a great case at a great price!! I recommend Khomo!!"
"The color is nice, and it actually has a great size. I just wanted it to have the screen cover as part of the case. It is not bad, but I like the other type of cas a little better. I feel the other cases are more protective. Next time I will get the more expensive case, when it is on sale (smile)."
"I bought this assembly when my S4 was dropped before my tempered glass screen protector shipped from Amazon (how unlucky). Being relatively tech savvy, I was able to search Youtube for a DIY vid and complete the replacement in less than 30 minutes. Everything went smoothly and the LCD assembly was perfect OEM quality. Definitely a great buy, but hopefully the last time I have to.I would highly recommend doing your research prior to tackling this project if you plan to do it yourself just to make sure that you connect the cables properly."
so far this is a good product. although my daughter had a hard time figuring out how to get it on her phone. But she figured out something. We have not tested the water feature but while washing dishes water splashed on it and she came to tell me that the phone was unharmed. But that is just a splash. All in all a good product for the price. If we test the water theory I will update my review.
"I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had it protected inside an &#34;Otter Box - Defender&#34; case. I didn't like having to open the bottom of the case every day and trying to fool with inserting the Micro USB charging cable. I started researching the possibility of purchasing a wireless Qi charging pad. There were several to choose from, but my phone also required that I purchase a Wireless Receiver Coil, in order for my phone to &#34;communicate&#34; with the wireless charging pad. The receiver coil is a small &#34;card-like&#34; device that is placed inside the back cover of my Galaxy S4. I kept reading reviews about the thickness of some of the cards causing the back cover to buldge. I definately didn't want that, so I finally settled on the TechMatte Qi Receiver Coil. I also read that the card would or could interfere with the phone's NFC functions. (which is the phone's ability to transfer information between one phone and another by simply touching them together) When the TechMatte Receiver Coil arrived, I took my phone out of the Otter Box, and removed my back from the phone. The Receiver has two small connector pins that connect to the inside of my Galaxy S4 by simply placing the connector pins over the two small contacts on the inside of my phone. The Coil has a piece of removable sticky tape that you remove, which allows the Coil to stick to the top of my battery, thus holding it in place. I then snapped the back, back onto my phone and put it back inside the Otter Box. The Coil is about as thick as a standard business card, and I noticed NO buldge on the back of my phone at all. Once I had everything back together, I placed my phone on the charging pad, and everything worked beautifully! NO MORE USB CABLE FOR CHARGING... I only use the cable now for transferring data. I then met a friend for lunch, and decided to test the NFC function, since she has the same exact phone. I opened a photo, turned on the NFC functions on both phones, touched the phones together, and the photo transferred in about 5 seconds to her phone. Everything worked great. I love the product, and the customer service is great also. I received a couple of emails from Kristin asking how I liked the Receiver Coil, and she also included contact information should I have any concerns, comments, or questions. If your tired of fooling with a USB cable for charging, you will LOVE going wireless. I simply lay my phone on the charging pad, and it beeps, then tells me that wireless charging is now being performed. The charging pad that I purchased will charge thru the Otter Box with no problem whatsoever. (http://www.amazon.com/New-Arrival-LuguLake-Qi-Enabled-Wireless/dp/B00FXJAISW/ref=sr_1_2?s=wireless&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1393517726&sr;=1-2)Since purchasing the items and telling several of my friends, they too have purchased the TechMatte Receiver Coil and LuguLake Charging pad and all of them are loving it... No problems at all with charging their phone or NFC functions."
"Very pleasantly surprised - it works for every application.  I am not using it heavily, so I cannot attest to its durability, but it works well and it is cheaper than a genuine Apple cable.  I love that it retracts and therefore fits nicely in my briefcase.  I got it for $14 a couple of weeks ago but see that the price has gone up.  I also see that it is pretty much sold out, so I guess I cannot blame them."
"I wanted to try an 'old school' wired headset due to complaints that my blue tooth headset wasn't being heard well by people I was talking to. I also wanted to just try something that needs no batteries or charging to work properly!I use it with my Samsung Captivate.This actually is a great earpiece, especially for the price over even a cheap blue tooth model. It is pretty comfortable for occasional wear, but for me not for long wear like my Plantronics Voyager blue tooth headset is. The audio quality, listening and talking, is first rate! I hear everyone fine and they've said they hear me with no fading, static, or drop out on either end of the conversation, audio quality wise.Although my unit came with no directions of any kind, it isn't rocket science or complicated to adjust it for your left or right ear. Volume is adjusted through the phone itself and not through this headset as with all the blue tooth headsets I've had and used.There is one button on the boom near the microphone I believe it is to 'hang up' when done, but I haven't needed to use it. The supplied cable is adequately long enough to keep the phone in a shirt or jacket pocket and easily reach with extra wire length to my head/ear. It also includes a clothes clip on the wire.This model came with a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter, a plus so you don't have to buy the adapter again separately and gives the option of different phones and even different headsets.When wearing it the headset is actually fairly small, smaller than it looks it would be in the photos, and even though it's chrome it kind of disappears and can really give you that crazy talking to yourself look!For the excellent Amazon price I feel you can't lose!! I highly recommend it!"
"Very nice product, fits perfectly, good materials, good work spigen, the only thing is that would be better if it include with a screen protector."
"This does exactly what it says.  It charges a battery outside the phone, and it does it perfectly fine. It appears to be genuine Motorola.  Lights indicate the charging status and when the charge is complete.  It's a bargain."
I had to try 3 times before I got it properly applied and I still had a single piece of lint.
"This is my first set of bluetooth headphones and they work great, for the most part. I use these with my Touch Pro 2 and the Pocketplayer App. The controls are great and it's comfotable. Only two complaints. First is sound quality, the sound is clear and decent highs just not enough bass for me. I'm use to the Shure SE530's with is in a class of it's own. So for the normal person that is use to the standard Ipod ear buds they are going to sound great. The second grips is if I have my device on my hip the sound cuts out sometimes when i'm working out but if I just set it on a bench or on the floor under the gym I can walk around about a 25ft radius with no problem, kinda odd but it's cool. It's worth the money."
"I highly recommend purchasing this alongside the -Seidio DILEX Extended Case with Metal Kickstand-I have been using them for quite some time, yes it's a bit bulky but you will get use to it and love the extra juice it provides"
"As a technology lover with multiple devices, from phones to kindles to external batteries, having one adapter that can charge them all at the same time is pretty awesome. It&#8217;s a pretty simple adapter, with one 2.4A output plugs and three 1A output plugs. The 2.4A output is typically used for larger devices such as tablets which require more power to charge, whereas the 1A outputs are used for things like phones, etc. That being said, it shouldn&#8217;t damage your phone even if you plug it into the 2.4A output plug, since your phone is the device that controls how much power it ultimately receives. It&#8217;s well made, and I haven&#8217;t experienced any safety issues related to it.Onto the device itself&#8211;it&#8217;s a rectangle about the size of your drivers license (a little bit smaller), and there&#8217;s a two pronged plug which you can tuck into the device to make it more compact. Once you plug it in a blue light near the output ports will light up to let you know that there&#8217;s electricity running. It&#8217;s kind of a nifty feature, but it might bother some at night. It&#8217;s not too bright or anything though, and I personally think it looks pretty cool.Overall, it works well, and if you&#8217;re sick of carrying multiple USB wall adapters, you&#8217;d love this charger. It&#8217;s compact, well-made, and does its job, all at a reasonable $15 price.Feel free to direct any questions to the comment section below**Please note I was given a review unit"
"I was very excited to get this product to find out that it's very poorly made.. The phone did not snap into the case, the bottom was loose and the phone kept coming out. Maybe mine was a defective item since I bought it solemnly based on reviews :( I returned it for refund. Also you can see the glue where the color meets the transparent material, like a child just took a superglue and played around creating a phone case. I SOOO wanted to like the product but oh well... off to the next one"
"I can't believe that I used to spend $12-$22 for EACH of these!  Yes, it takes a couple of weeks for them to arrive from half-way around the world, but for less than $1 apiece (we use 20+ at a time in my office) I can keep a supply on hand and order before I get too low and wait patiently for replenishments to arrive."
"This charger stopped working properly soon after the first iOS4 update.  I was getting a popup message ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"".  You can fix this by installing a Cydia app named ""NoAccessorySplash iOS4"" and it will fix the problem, but this is a Cydia app.  You do not have a Jailbroken phone if you do not know what Cydia is."
"Darkens screen much and you have to turn up the brightness to the screen of the smartphone, so just very fast smartphone battery. The material feels good, but could be better. good day."
Have had first cover on for over four months and no problems!  Was also very easy to install the first time.
"This is an OK battery for a backup.  It doesn't last as long as the OEM 2800mAh battery, but it does last OK, about 80% as durable as the OEM original.  I will say one thing, it lasts as long as other batteries in Amazon that claim to be 4300mAh batteries.  Don't believe 4300, it's a lie, so I gave this one another star just because it was closer to the truth."
"I would strongly recommend this case to anyone. It fits my Samsung Galaxy SIII perfectly and looks great! I have already dropped my phone and this case has protected it really well. The color is very different from how it appears in the picture (instead of a bright teal or turquoise it is more of a soft mint green) however, it still looks great and I love the color!"
"I chose this blackberry that is comfortable and have good price.I like it so cheap and easy to use.recommend anyone to buy an equal, not regret"
I liked the size and feel of this.  When I received it the pen wouldn't twist up.  Ended up returning.
"Worth the money, but it doesn't fit very snugly, and lacks frontal protection that I need for possible drops.Fits so loose, that it would be possible for the cover to slip-off during insertion or removal from a pocket.I suppose the case is worth the less than Twelve dollar price, but, in my opinion, this case doesn't fit perfectly,and does not offer sufficient protection for an active lifestyle.Does the job, but lacks perfect fit & robust protection.I would not buy again. However, not bad enough to return. I should've read the reviews more carefully."
this saved me so much time than spending a ton of money on replacing my screen and i love the free tools it came with it helped alot and i thought the screen wouldn't actually have to samsung sign on it but it did and it makes it look like brand new this is for people who want to save money!
dealer delivered product quickly but very disapointed in item.loved the color but product was not durable.fit was perfect but the clips that hold it to the phone was to small & broke when clipped to phone.
"I would recommend this product to friends and family ... I have a red, green and black one ... Fits perfect for my iPhone 5 ... But I have bought a case for my phone for more protection!!!"
I think this is more durable than the wall wart + usb charge cable that shipped with my tablet.  I bought a couple to have around.
Have no probs with this cahrger till date but the phone screen went blank and dont know why. I can't see who calls neither can I dial cos its a touch screen. had to ger a blackberry fone.
the color is somewhat different from the photos (BLUE); it gets really bright under the sunlight and gets fairly dark when less lights are around.It still gives fairly good protection and the buttons are easily accessible.
I use these all over the house and car in case I forget them and I pass them around to friends!
"I really did love this thing, great sound and noise cancelling worked far better than others I tried. I just wish jawbone would make an android app for locating it when lost... so I could have found it when I initially lost it."
"I've owned various Apple products for over 5 years now that require this kind of connector and I can't believe I waited this long to get a 6 ft. cable! What is wrong with me? Moreover, what is wrong with Apple for only making a 3ft cable?Totally worth the purchase. Now I can read in bed or draw on my tablet without having to hover next to the wall socket. The connector is taller than Apple's, so you have to watch that the cord is kept straight or with enough slack that you don't put any additional drag on the socket, but otherwise it's perfect!EDIT (8/1/2013): So after about 4 months of use, my cable quit working completely. Not sure if the connection problem is on the USB end or the i-connector end, but it's dead. I see a some other reviews say that as well, followed by a ""don't waste your money"" message. Come on, it's a $9 cable, folks. I had another one for back-up I'm still using, and I plan to get another one again so I can have two (one for home and one for the road). Yeah, it's a bummer that it broke so I'm reducing my rating by one star, but I still got my $9 of use out of it in that 4 months, and my other one is still going strong. It's a cable, not magic."
"The most important is that the item is brand new and original , as the market today is full of copies and a lot of garbage , every body says they sell geniune accessories and they send you fake"
"This is probably the third or fourth iPhone screen protector I've used, and I found it to be just as easy to install as any of the others.  Make sure the screen is wiped down REALLY well before you try to apply it.  These screen protectors come with a cloth for that.  There can't be ANY dust on the screen, otherwise you will definitely get a bubble.  The screen protector has 2 pieces of film covering the 2 sides, so you just peel off the first one, line it up with the edge of your iPhone screen, and start applying it slowly from one side of the phone to the other.  The screen protector is cut to EXACTLY the dimensions of the iPhone screen, so there is no room for error when you are lining it up.  Applied carefully enough, there is actually no need for the little mini-squeegee tool that it comes with.The screen protector is made really well, and I have no complaints about the quality.  It covers the entire glass face of the iPhone, rather than just a rectangle over the display part as some screen protectors do.  It is very durable, doesn't seem to scratch too easily, and it doesn't affect the sensitivity of the touch-screen.  I would definitely recommend these for any iPhone owner."
"This little device is great!  I've used it while traveling to charge my iPad, iPhone, Jambox, and Kindle. It charges devices quickly, and the flashlight works well in a pinch.At the price, this purchase was a no-brainer!"
For the price you can't lose. These fit well and are a good value. Not the highest quality but I'm sure you knew that...
"This case fits my phone perfectly. I like the two layers of protection. I use the belt clip more as another layer of protection for the face of my phone (I work in construction).  Because of the rubber inner layer, it is a little difficult to slide the phone in and out of the belt holder quickly, but it holds the phone nicely. I haven't used the kickstand yet, but it is a nice option to have instead of holding your phone during movies or videos. For my needs, it is a great case for the price!"
"the charger is very compact and works great in my car but the phone stopped recognizing the lightning cable 2 days after I got it, it also happened to any other non Apple cable I've used so it was not a surprise to me......."
"I bought this for my brothers' smart phone. He did not want an all over cover, however he did want the face to scratch. I thought this would solve the problem and it did. Mrs. J. McPherson"
"LOVE this case, still in great condition its pretty and works! Would def recommend this to whoever! BUY IT NOW"
I bought this for my galaxy s2 from sprint? And it was a perfect fit. It came with 2 screen protectors. My husbands one that we got from sprint was coming off and that screen protector did not even cover the whole screen.  so one was for him and one for me. You pay a little more but it was sure worth the price. It fit so perfect that i bought another one for my brother... WORTH IT............
I had to replace my Motorola 710 Bluetooth head seat since it was not able to maintain a charge.  My old head set was a good 4 to 5 years old.  I had heard good things about Jawbone and this headset fit my budget and needs.  I use it daily since I like to use my hands free when I drive.  The sound is much better than what I experienced on  old headset and the person I am calling hears me better than before.
"If you are looking for all around protection (including ""lay on the table"" design) then this is the case to get.  It is the perfect blend of size and strength.  It's not as thick as the Incase Slider, but you get identical coverage.  Further, the CaseCrown case has MUCH better connecting pieces than the Incase Slider also.  The seam is almost invisible in the black color.  It's a tight fight and yet it doesn't interfere with your screen protector (can't use screen protector on Incase Slider).  This is the best slider/glider case on the market right now.ONLY gripe is that I wish the CaseCrown logo on the back wasn't so large and prominent.Forgot to mention that the cutout for the lightning port on the bottom is big enough to fit 3rd party plugs.  I tested the 30pin to 8pin lightning adapter as well as a micro usb to 8pin lightning adapter both from DX.com and they both work great."
"The pens come in an assortment of colors and 2 different sizes, small & large. All pens work great with both my Android & iOS devices."
i really liked this case. it fit well and looked good on my phone. i even bought other colors to change it up
"it was nice until the glue that held the plastic phone cradle came off the wallet portion. Oh, and it doesn't stay upright when trying to use it as a stand to watch movies/use in landscape mode.Cheap, cheap, cheap. You get what you pay for I guess. Very disappointed."
Needed for the car to charge my cell phone. Plugged it in and it works perfect. I have several products from Liger and I've been extremely pleased with them all. Fair prices and high quality electronics.
"I have tried a couple of the ""other brand"" so-called soft cases for my new 9930 Blackberry. I was less than impressed with them. But THIS! This is exactly what a soft case should be, thick, cushy, nice feel. I originally took a star off my rating because it seemed to me the surface was a bit slick, not teflon slick, more silicon slick. I put the star back on when I put the phone in my pocket. If it were more rubbery it would be a pain to pocket. Look carefully at the picture, its exactly the same. The openings line up good, you wont be able to put this on a charging pod without removing the case or modifying it. I never used a case before because I always had a very large extended battery on my other Blackberrys. Choosing a good one was more of a chore than I thought it would be. I think I have other cases coming in, if there is a better one I'll review it."
neat gaget that works very well at home holding my phone on my desk.  good quality...good pricing...I am not sure how they hold on a dash but it works like a charm on my desk
"I don't understand how this is getting such great reviews!  Do people not know how to test a product before writing a review?!?  I put this thing out in the sun (no clouds) for a full day.  The next day I tried charging my smartphone.  Within 30minutes the battery pack on the solar unit was reading fully empty, and my phone had only charged 3%!  I left my phone charging in the sun with the battery of the solar unit dead (it should still charge).  2 hours later with perfect sunlight and my phone was actually DOWN 2 %!Who knows maybe I got a faulty unit.  I wanted to use this small solar panel because it is supposed to have 800mAh solar output and it should be able to charge something like a 5000mAh battery backup every day.  I wanted to use this in conjunction with a 5000mAh backup battery for a camping trip.  After testing it's obvoius this simply won't work, not even at all!I admit this left a bad taste in my mouth for the instapark brand; however, the next best option I have is to try the Instapark 10.  So I sent back my 4S for a refund and am waiting on the 10 to arrive to test it.  All I need is to fully charge a 5000mAh backup battery once a day.  This shouldn't be such a hard thing to do with technology of today!"
Very cheap and easy way to hang your phone. Works as expected but the mangent could be a little stronger
"I received this today.  It seemed to be charged because I got the flashing blue Bluetooth searching mode light to come on but it would not connect with any of my other Bluetooth devices.  I figured it might need a charge so I tried to plug in the included USB cable and no go, it feels funny going into the headset connector and does not charge the unit.  I've asked for a replacement and will update this review based on that unit.UPDATE: 12/27/2010I received the replacement headphone and it connected right off.  Also the USB cable worked and the unit charged.  Sound quality is decent for inexpensive headphones and the range is good as well.  They are comfortable to wear.  I am using them for PC gaming and will probably get a bluetooth phono jack adapter and use them when I watch TV.If it wasn't that the original was received defective I would have probably rated these 5 stars from a value/performance basis alone.  As long as you buy items sold by Amazon you actually don't have to worry much about defective product because they will next day your replacement to you.So after a rocky start I'd now recommend that you give these a try."
"I really love this case. It fits my inspire 4g perfectly. It shipped directly from China and got to me prior to the projected date.If it gets damaged, I'll be buying another one......in fact I'll get it anyway."
"My 2 year old BodyGlove case finally gave up, from taking it off everyday to charge my Bionic with a docking station....this cover from Fishbone has a gel body with a hard plastic backbone that keeps it in place. Can't somebody make a good cover that will allow charging? Verizon has eliminated the &#34;early upgrade&#34;......I bought new batteries and charging docks, and they can now wait for me to &#34;re-up&#34;...........:)"
"I was not sure whether to apply a screen protector to my new Galaxy S3.  I had a Galaxy S1 for over two years without a screen protector and there were only very minor scratches on that screen (always kept it in a leather holster when not in use).  However, during a recent vacation the S1 screen did not survive a drop on a rocky path during a hike...  I ordered these screen protectors since they had good reviews and the price is very reasonable.  I found the protector easy to apply and I did not do anything else beyond thoroughly cleaning the screen (no compressed air, steamy shower room, etc.).  There are no visible dust particles or air bubbles under the protector. The set comes with a small cleaning cloth and a very useful soft card that allows you to remove any remaining bubbles.  The protector covers the phone display completely, but does not cover the complete front of the phone as observed by others.  This actually suits me fine, since I have a case that slightly wraps around the sides of the phoneShell Holster Combo Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 with Kick-stand (At&t;, Verizon, T-mobile, Us Cellular & Sprint)Overall I am happy with the result: a good compromise between protection and aesthetics.  The protector is visible, but it does not interfere with the feeling of the touch screen or the clarity of the display.  I will see how the protector holds up over time and how if it survives the use with the holster combo, since the phone slides in that holster with the screen towards the holster.One minor negative so far (hence the four stars): there is a narrow edge around the whole of the protector that is a bit lighter, almost like it is lifting from the screen.  It is less than 0.5 mm and only visible in bright light conditions, so not really a problem for me.  Please also note that I do not observe any reduction in glare as a result of the protector, despite that claim in the specifications."
When i first bought this charger it was charging my phone with no problem. About three weeks later it stopped charging my phone a;; together. You have to push the charger in so the blue light shows. That means its in far enough to charge but the blue light never shows now and it doesnt charge my phone. Figures it wouldnt work being that it wasa so cheap.
"This is my second Candy Grip Case. I was very happy with the first one. It lay flat on the table, and would not slide or move when I use the phone.That's the reason why I bought this one in purple. It looks good, but it is warped, so it slides on the table and moves from side to side when I dial phone numbers without picking the phone up.Really not too happy about this product. I thought that Speck has much highest standards.July 19, 2013:sometimes a company would contact me after I have given a bad review. They would send me another case, in exchange for a better review. Not so SPECK!very disappointed in this case and also the company. I would be hesitant to buy another SPECK product. I do not have the time to call them, so I guess I just take my loss on this case.In my of original review I gave them two stars, but now It is down to one."
"It works great, but weirdly the phone does not charge while i am using it, while it takes a very long time for the phone to lose power, it does not charge when in use. I wonder is this is me alone or if its because i am doing something wrong, i will search online later and see what was the issue."
"Tired of having to talk next to the wall while your iphone is charging and the cable is really too short?Buy this one, i actually got 2 of these.i feel so free now :DBuy this."
"Car mount holders are a must for any driver. Even if you have a friend sitting next to you, asking for directions is a pain. I rent cars (zipcar and enterprise) occasionally for small trips. The problem with traditional car mount holders is that they loose grip soon after you start plugging/unplugging them regularly. and obviously you cannot fix a permanent mount on rental cars.Airframe is by far the best portable mount holder as well as the most compact. Little expensive than other cheaper ones. But definitely worth the price being handy and easy to use."
"Excellent product, will receive quite a workout during my daily routines and travel endeavors !!Would / have recommended it to friends....................."
"Well, I have to admit this charger is perfect. It charges my iphone, fits well and cost me less than three bucks. Gotta love it."
Once applied and dried you would never know the skin is there.  I purchase a hard case with this.  The hard case has a built in screen protector which I plan on removing and just use the skinomi as the protector.  if there is a version for my wife's 2g or 3g I will buy another.  Not sure though how to claim on lifetime warranty if the need arises.
"I thought I put in the search bar &#34;tempered screen protector GS5&#34; hoping to find a tempered glass screen protector.  Somehow I ended up finding this one (a 3 pack) and ordered it. I was surprised when I opened the package, but put one on anyway.  This fit well, and was easier to put on than any other screen protector that I've used on 11 phones in 5 years.  It's too soon to tell how it will hold up, but so far I'm happy with it."
"First off, I was an idiot and bought these for my T-Mobile Note, not noticing that these are for the non-US Note with the physical button at the bottom.  I still have been using them since I got my Note.  They went on easily enough with no air bubbles and you can't even tell it's on the screen.  The bad part, is that they are so easily scratched, that the phone won't recognize gestures/S-Note writing after a short period of use.  Since this is the main reason I got the Note in the first place, these screen protectors are of no use to me.  If you're just going to navigate everything with your finger alone, these may work for you."
"This battery is great. I use my phone all day and it never needs the charger. I start about 7am and this thing didn't die until 8pm after the first charge. I do YouTube, Pandora, Facebook, MMA.com, UFC.com, high bandwidth sites, and tons of HQ videos. I didn't need to cycle it, wait a day, count to three, cycle it again, etc. Charged it to full right out of the box, been great ever since.The battery door however does not fit snug towards the top of my phone. Unsure if it's just this one case or what. It doesn't want to fit tight. Again just at the top. Great combo."
I had the defender and the bulkiness of it got on my nerves. This case is perfect. even with the case on my phone is about the same thickness as my girlfriends 4G.
"Before this 3M projector arrived, I had two main concerns:1) Would it be bright enough?2) Which iPhone apps are compatible?Here is what I found:1) The brightness is quite good.  3M's own specs say this has a brightness of ""up to ANSI 35 lumens"" (from 3M's own specs).  Though this may sound rather low, I found that this projects photos, videos, and text very well when used as recommended.  ""as recommended"" means a diagonal of 10 inches to 60 inches.  Clearly, this is a ""hobby"" type of device.  Don't plan a professional business presentation with this projector.  Keep your expectations reasonable.  In a dimly lit room, with your iPhone projecting on a wall 10 feet away, images and text look good.2) I was afraid that this device would be limited to Apple's own video and photo apps and nothing more.  I was happy to find that it worked with quite a few of my go-to apps.  But, there are some apps which did NOT work with this projector.  So, here are some specifics you might care about (and note that what works may depend on which version of iOS you are running, as well as which version of each app you are running):* Netflix: works under both iOS 5.1 and iOS 6* Hulu Plus: works under both (however, I needed to update the app...an older version of Hulu Plus didn't work)* YouTube: works under iOS 5.1, but NOT under iOS6 (probably due to the fact that Apple kicked YouTube out of its built-in apps, and the downloadable YouTube app does NOT project)* Apple's official Photos and Videos apps: work under both (note that the photo app only works in ""slideshow"" mode, meaning you can't swipe through your pictures...you'll be at the mercy of the slideshow timer)* KeyNote: works under both3M's spec sheet says that this device is for iOS 4 and iOS 5.  However, I have had no trouble using this with iOS 6.There are other reasons to recommend this:* I like that the sleeve can be used as a charger for my iPhone.  In other words, when I don't need to use it as a projector, it can serve as a backup charger instead.  Note that it cannot be used as both a projector and a charger simultaneously.  It's one or the other.* There is a button that allows me to switch among projection modes: a mode for brighter video, a mode for sharper contrast when viewing text, and a mode for preserving battery life by dimming the screen.  3M says this will last for 100 minutes of projecting before needing to be charged.  Though I haven't tested it, I would assume this means ""100 minutes when using the mode that preserves the battery"".* The sleeve holds the phone securely: Once the phone is slid into the sleeve, there is an edge around the sleeve that securely holds the phone in place.  It takes a fair amount of effort to remove the phone.  In other words, once the phone is in the sleeve, you don't have to worry about it sliding out or falling out, regardless of how you hold it.  Keep in mind that this is NOT meant to be a protective sleeve.  I would only leave it in the sleeve when you want to use it as a charger or a projector.All in all, this is a decent projector for the price.  It works with the apps I care about (though not YouTube, but for me that's not a deal breaker).  Interested in showing a video or photos to a small group of people?  This might be just what you're looking for."
"I LIKE THIS CASE,BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO TAKE IT OFF WHEN I WANT TO CHANGE MY CASE.SEEM'S LIKE IT SHOULD OF BEEN A SNAP ON FRONT AND BACK CASE."
"These are very nice, apply with no problem, 5X front and back, great deal for theprice. Other brand names are over priced and in most cases you only get the frontprotector. Highly recommend these from etech."
I like this case a lot. It's very cute and makes me feel nice but it's not very good in the protective area. But it works none the less.
"My husband loves this case. He actually thought it would be too bulky because the phone is so narrow, but it works really well, protects the phone like it should, and makes all the buttons very easy to use as protective as it is. If you're looking for a very protective case then this one should work very well for you."
"Its look like OEM but, quality is very bad. Spend little more & buy a Sony headset. Those are way better."
"...however, if you plan to stick this to your dashboard, you better have your own crazy glue because the dashplate just wouldn't stick to ANY surface even after having been left applied for two days with no disturbance. Otherwise, GREAT product at a SUPER LOW price."
nice and rough
This is a very tough and well built case highly recommended.  I have had issues with clip cases because the clip always breaks and although you have to feed this one through your belt I know it will last.
The noise 2.5 blocked out so much of the background noise and was very well in that regard.However but for such a premium headset the battery life should have been better by far and the earbuds are bogus and the earloop isnt even worth talking about smh.
"I'm not sure what some of the negative reviewers are talking about.  The charger and usb cable I received works perfectly.  No loose connections what so ever.  In fact, the MicroUSB cable is snug enough to hold my Samsung Galaxy Note phone suspended in mid air.Strongly recommended."
"This is the coolest screen protector EVER. It was easier to install because it isn't as wobbly as the cheap ones. It's a little flexible, but it's real tempered glass! I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and here's what I love about it: It feels like the factory glass, not tacky like some screen protectors. It's easy to clean. It came with everything needed to install, including instructions. It also came with button stickers. The only drawback is that the glass &#34;cut&#34; is off just a tad. It is cut to allow the button to be a button, and it is cutout at the top so it doesn't cover the speaker, LED, front camera, etc. Mine is a little wider on the right, so if you look close, it looks crooked. But then, if you look REALLY close, you can tell it's not crooked, but just uneven. I'm okay with it because this one was much cheaper than the name-brand ones and works perfectly."
"In my opinion the most important characteristic of a Kindle cover is weight.  Readers should be able to hold their kindles with a single hand and adding a protective cover shouldn't diminish the device's ease of use.  The Verso nicely gives you the necessary protection for your kindle and keeps the weight down.  The design is also nice (from my wife's perspective) and the kindle stays snug.  I did however encounter one disappointing result from using the cover - the front section lost its alignment with the back cover so when it's closed the two halves (front and back) don't line up - they've off by about an 1/4 inch or so.  Not a big deal and the problem could certainly have been caused by my wife and I folding the front cover behind the back cover when reading.  Overall this is a solid cover and if you like the design, is a good buy.Tips for using this product:- Don't fold the front cover behind the back cover or you'll risk causing the two halves to permanently mis-align.  This doesn't change the functional value of the cover and is more of an aesthetic issue.Product Strengths:- Excellent workmanship and quality- Light weight, still allows the reader to hold the kindle/cover using a single hand comfortably.- Affordable price and excellent value- Solid attachments for anchoring your kindle into the cover, prevents your kindle from moving around.Product Weaknesses:- None really other than the aforementioned cover alignment issue.Would I Recommend?Yes, if you like the design, this is a great quality cover for the price.Rating Justification:5 stars for high quality manufacturing, 5 stars for value and ease of use, 5 stars for low weight, five stars attachment to kindle, four stars for exterior design - overall 5 stars."
"I have to update this, originally when I tried it out I couldn't get it working on anything.Now I actually think this is related to the android software and not the cable.Because while I was digging through my cables box I came across this OTG cable which I discarded to the side and decided to try it again.Right now my Samsung Galaxy S3 is running KitKat 4.4, and when I tried the cable and now it works with both a mouse and keyboard."
"I gave up and threw mine away when it would not work correctly on any device. Ear phones on one, Mic on another. Poor Quality. I expected better from Jabra!"
"The dashboard car mount does a good job holding my husband's iPhone 4S in an otterbox defender series case.  The phone fits securely, and it stays put on the dashboard very well.  I think this model would work with just about any phone out there because it is very easy to adjust.  My only complaint is that it feels cheaply made, but so far it is holding up alright."
This is a berry good deal! I wanted a longer and thicker cable because the little factory cable broke. These guys had just what I wanted and the price is great. Thanks to this seller and Amazon.com!!!
Worked just as described no weird fitting issues or anything. If you cracked the back of your verizon iPhone 4 this is perfect.
"They fit to the screen perfectly and stick well. I was always concerned that the screen protector would get in the way and not feel au natural. These are perfect though, I would never know there was one on there. Cheap price too."
"Protects just as good as an Otterbox!  Love the color, but waiting to receive the case was torture! Happy customer"
"I purchased this case at Sam's Club when I got my phone (I would have purchased on amazon for half the cost, but figured I would have dropped the phone by the time I received it).  That being said, it comes with a very thick screen protector, which does NOT contour the edges of the screen very well, and looks terrible.  I am actually surprised they sell it with one because of how bad it looks.The case itself is pretty nice. The buttons are very easy to press.  I tried both Otterbox cases prior to trying this one.  The Otterbox cases are just too big for this phone.  My main complaint about this case is that it rubs the edges of the screen protectors, causing them to start coming off.  I use Zagg screen protectors on all my devices, and this particular case is problematic with rubbing the edges.This case does pick up a bit of dust as well, but not too bad.I will likely be getting rid of this case for that reason, and switching over to the Urban Armor Gear case for the S3.  A friend of mine has it and it is far superior than any case I have seen.  That case also doesn't seem to rub the screen protectors off.UPDATE 9-4-13I went to the Zagg kiosk at the mall and they replaced my original Zagg with the HD version (for a small fee).  There is also a version of the Zagg designed to work with cases like the Incipio and is held away from the edges a bit.  I was pretty happy after that switch.I still bought a UAG case and love it!  It doesn't grip my pockets when I try and get my phone out...and no lint collecting!"
"This product is good, though I might have gotten a defective one since the volume button only works to lower down the volume not to raise it. It's simple, but maybe a little too simple for me."
"The original was a little over a year old and my phone was freezing up a lot (original Samsung Galaxy S). The phone was replaced under warranty from my wireless carrier but the new phone (new, not refurbished) kept freezing up as well. The sales girl at the carrier's store recommended that I replace the battery with a new one from amazon.I wanted to purchase a new battery directly from Samsung, but they were out of stock at the time.I took a chance and purchased this replacement on March 15th (today is May 22). The battery is working the same as the day I got it and the phone freezes less than it was before replacing the battery."
"I originally wanted to use it for my desk at work, however that was not practical as I had to keep taking the case on and off in order to set in the cradle.  I took it home and use it as my alarm.  Yes I still have to take the case off but only once a night as compared to multiple times during work. It works great though, easy to set in cradle and looks nice.  My only suggestion would be to make it to accommodate the phone and a case. Then it would be perfect."
"I like this case it fits the phone pretty good . The belt clip is okay ,I feel little more secure having my phone in this case. Their is a little play when the phone is in the case but nothing real noticeable. I would recommend this case."
"This is a fantastic charger. It's small and compact size make it great for traveling. The product also appears well made, so it won't break on you. If you aren't traveling, the Anker 40w 5V/8A 5 port auto-adjusting item is a better option (it has a longer cable that is less than ideal for traveling). This is the fastest charger I've ever seen when charging my iPhone and iPad."
Very small charger that fits flush into my car charger. I bought this because I have an 08 Lexus IS which is very cramped in the center console and this works perfectly. Charges quickly with 1 amp.
purchased  spare cover as I was not sure how the other cover would hold up and if it would need to be replaced. spare cover  is stored now and  will be used  when needed.
"Nuff said.Ok since 18 more words are required, I will end by saying you will not be let down =)"
"The Otterbox case is a wonderful product that has kept my phone safe from everything it has encountered.The problem with the product isn't in its ability to keep my phone safe but in its lack of keeping it look clean. I deal with money on a daily bases and as many of you know it can be a dirty job. Unfortunately, the case's soft material attracts the dirt and just doesn't let go. Offering a product that does one thing well just doesn't cut it when it doesn't look good doing it."
"I got this to replace my 1 year old OEM battery on a Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch.  This one is wayyyyy better.  I got at least 50% more time on this one than the original.UPDATE 7/30/2013.  Been running this battery for 2 1/2 months and has been good until the last few days.  The battery would not charge at all and finally died today.UPDATE 8/1/2013.  Battery is good, my phone was bad.  All of a sudden the phone would drastically drain all of my batteries after taking a long time to charge full."
This review was written by my wifeThe Belkin Grip Candy Case for the iPhone 5 is an excellent choice for someone who wants a slim case that gives good protection. The back of the case is hard plastic but the edges are kind of rubberized so they do not slip our of your hand.There is a thin lip around the front edge which gives some protection if you drop the phone onto the front screen.  Also the buttons are easy to use.........and of course the 2 tone pink/purple color is pretty!
"Bought for my friend, she liked the previous one(but yellow)from the same seller.. It has nice quality and can protect phone just greatly"
Came fast. The print looks nice. Defenetly reccomend. This is a great way to get a cute case for an amazing prince.
"I bought this to replace my Amazon branded car charger, that was truly a pain.  The Amazon charger had to constantly be twisted to start charging and would often need readjusted.  This unit doesn't do that to me.  It fits in snug and lights up blue when charging.  It has a higher power 2.1 slot and can charge two devices at once.  Any device that will charge off of USB will work.  So now we have one for my wife's iPhone and my Galaxy S4 on the 2.1 side.  I'm very happy with this charger and would recommend it."
I love this charger.  I ordered it for my kendel.  It works absolutely great. The price was cut in half and it works so well. It's way faster charging with.  Check the requirement but on the high def and the old one.  It's great.  I have both.
"Makes your phone look very nice, and has a very handsome appearance. Made of a strong aluminum and well finished. An asset to you phones appearance."
"I got mine from Verizon store, i do like the case, it is not slippery coz of the rubberized edge. The back is transparent!(people will see you and feel to be famous and get jealous coz you are using iPhone 5) before using it make sure put screen protector(to avoid scratching transparent at the back) and put photos before install hehehe. And believe me I am not hundred percent perfect person but our phone will get scratch  soon I will get a new iPhone or could be an iPhone 5S or new smartphone. Griffin please make a new one that has anti-scratch transparent at the back,rubberized edge was designed perfectly! and something tough small hang, I meant so that we can put strap in it and like a necklace."
"Works great. Came as expected. Decent quality, nothing to hoot and holler about. Economically sufficient yet surprisingly effective. Great as portable toilet paper if stranded in the woods!"
This is my first purchase with the extended battery.  The batter life on the original battery wasn't good (as everybody knows).  I saw this and figured I would give it a try.  It does add some weight to the overall phone but it's worth it.  I bought two more sets (with just the back cover and the case) so I can mix and match them.  Highly recommend.
"Okay, so maybe perfect for the S4 is a bit off. I do sometimes wish it had a little bit more of a cut out for the charger or the aux out cable, or whatever... but with a little fiddling, it always works just fine.It holds the phone very securely, never had any issues with it falling or even thinking about it falling.The suction cup is industrial strength. I've never seen one this effective, especially on glass. It's actually almost too effective, so if you will be moving this from car to car or something, you might want to just get 2 or 3 because it's NOT the easiest thing in the world to get back off once it's on there. That's a good thing, but, just ya know a practical note.Can't go wrong and I'm sure it would fit future phones you might have too...it's fairly &#34;universal&#34; for most larger smart phones."
i needed to get a good protector for my iphone because my husband took it and i upgraded my phone. he is ruff with screen protectors and this screen protector can take it all. i love the anti glare yes it works and the no finger print yes it works..now i dont look at his phone a cringe ..yayyyyy
"I haven't been able to drain this unit completely to test how long it takes to charge, but it I know it charges my Samsung GS5 just as quick as it does when plugged into the wall. Using an app to measure the current, it's measures at 1800 mAh while charging. Haven't tested the water-resistant feature but it looks the part. One downside I've found is that the rubber covers over the USB ports don't really stay closed. I find them opening on their own often (which would probably be troublesome for the water-resistant feature)."
It's a great screen shield and doesn't get scratches on it and feels good. For the great price everyone should buy it.
Everything was exactly what they said it was. IT worked perfectly and it is a great value for the price. Thank you. LOVE IT.
Brand name headphones exactly like what is sold with original GS3/GS4/GS5. Easy to use and very durable. Microphone is clear and buttons are very flush so you don't accidentally press them.
"This is a decent adapter for the price. It works as described.  Its construction is somewhat light but for the price, you can buy a few as spares. The 2.5mm TRRS male is not a right angle, but more like a 45. I recommend."
Slim. Light weight. Fits onto phone well and buttons align. I get bored easily and like to change my cases around.
I really enjoyed having this case on my phone :) After about a months use i only lost one diamond but it is not very obvious. The piece of plastic in front of the volume buttons also broke but it didnt affect the case. This is worth it for the price!
It's a smooth & cute case. Love the color & the feel of it. It's a great buy for the price.
"This clear case is nice because it has a front and a back, which I like in terms of protecting the screen; however, that being said, I think it makes the phone too thick. The hard plastic is not very thin, so another thing that bothers me is that where they have left cutouts, your finger has to go inside this deep hole to reach the buttons.  They did well though with the holes not impeding the charger, or creating problems with the camera.  I have not dropped my phone so I cannot speak to whether or not it scratches easily or protects the phone like the other reviewer.  I do note that it does NOT fit the phone quite right.  The phone moves around a bit in the case.  I agree with the other reviewer - it is hard to take the case off. It does not seem to gather dust though, in between the phone and the case."
"My daughter likes these cases.  They are simple to use and the colors are nice.  We have not had any problems with these cases.  The power button is easy to use with this case.  The butterflies are hard to see, but it is ok."
Bought it for my b/f and he loves it.  Convenient and allows easy retrieval when the phone rings.  He doesnt have to search for the phone as it is always on his belt. It has a real nice look
"This one is pretty ,but not a sturdy one, although I really like the stylis pen that came with it, so I don't use the cover but I do use the pen"
This product had been a good alternative to more expensive phone cases. It works just as good. With the price being so low we were able to get multiple colors.
"I ordered this because my husband likes to listen to Baseball games on AM Radio when doing yard work.  He used it for 3 days and gave me feedback for this review.  He said if you use it with your Itunes (or other bluetooth music device), it works great.  sound is clear, easy to wear, nice product. But alas, the AM was not good, or FM.  He just could not get any stations to come in.  He was really disappointed because of the size of this little guy and the great sound from the Itunes, he was hoping he could replace his old set and listen to ballgames on this-but it didn't work out so well."
"I wish the manufacturer would have given different color options or non transparent back option.  Other than that, it is the perfect case for this phone. You can push the buttons easily. If protects the phone well and you get a screen cover too! I highly recommend this case.P.S. this opinion / review is based on comparison of this case with ""supcase"" and ""caseology"" ... Supcase has the best fit. No gaps, nothing lose etc - BUT the buttons are very hard to push :(  I could not feel if I was pushing the buttons or not. Caseology is bulkier than what is shown in the pictures. The cuts for the buttons are too large etc. Spigen does have some gap at the charging port area but it doesnt bother me that much. Everything else fits well ... buttons are easy to push. Overall it is a good case."
I love speck cases but this was as durable. the blue started pealing really quickly and didnt hold up as much as my other speck case did. Really cute though
"Love these! Firstly, these were very cheap and I was in need of screen protectors for my new phone. I got these screen protectors expected the worst and hoping for the best, and I got the best! First off, these are SO easy to apply. Just two basic steps and your screen protector is perfectly applied. Second, the screen protector itself is very durable! I have been using these screen protectors for weeks and not one scratch is noticeable. Also, the anti-glare, anti-fingerprint works fantastic! These are great in sunlight and I NEVER see a fingerprint on my device! I love these and will continue to use these kinds of screen protectors!"
"This is a bumper that goes around the phone. The back is not at all covered. The bumper extends a bit over the front of the screen so I think would protect the screen in a minor drop incident. The functions of the phone, the volume and silence buttons are easily accessible and the bumper fits snugly on both the 4 and 4s."
"works very good, I have not had any problems with my bluetooth. i just love it. It's price was awesome also."
"If you can manage to get it on correctly, these are excellent. They fit the dinc 2 screen almost too well, there is no margin for error. I botched the first one, second I managed to get on correct except for one piece of lint that formed an air bubble. I was able to work the plastic thing underneath and scoop out the lint and now it's perfect. I probably got lucky. But now that it's on, no distortion, finger glides smoothly across screen, ideal. Way better than the griffin brand cut your own screen protectors my wife got at Walmart. Does attract smudges like CRAZY, but that's true of the touch screen itself."
"Boguht this battery about 10 months ago and it was amazing. i used it nonstop. i actually used the battery to much and wore it out, come to ifnd out it was defective. And Hyperion sent me a brand new one and that has lasted me for around 7-8 months and it has not had a problemm whatsoever. I highly recommend this to anyone who uses their phone all day and is consstantly using it."
"when i recieved this i was soooo happy because i don't have an outlet near me at my externship, i was able to use this for not even two minutes before it shut off and stopped charging.  So i plugged it back up and let it charge even though I charged it all night, it came back on said it was fully charged I plugged my phone up to it and it died again."
"love the long cord and color, a little slower than normal cord, but i use it to plug in my phone by my bed overnight, so it's not an issue for me"
"It is a great case that would provide enough protection in most everyday situations. The fit and finish is good, with all the cutouts in its respective places. I initially put the screen protector on as a stopgap between when the ones I ordered separately would come as I thought surely, any free protectors would be junky. However, I was pleasantly surprised and decided to keep it on until it needs to be changed, which may very well be the life of the phone.Ultimately, I decided to go with a hard case instead as I have grown accustomed to its feel and level of protection. I also enjoy the additional rigidity a hard case gives the phone, especially a thin and seemingly fragile phone like the S3. I will keep the Diztronic as a backup. If you like soft cases, you can't go wrong with this case."
i think i dropped my phone once or twice with this case on... No damage to case or phone so it does its job well.4 stars because it blocks wifi signal shortening the distance you can be from the WAP...  I guess this happens with all cases though...  :(
"Looks cute, shipped fast and I feel like it will offer some protection to my phone. It allows me to use all the buttons and charging ports with out taking it off. I would buy it again"
Does what it is meant to do. not sure what else can be said about it.Good price here on Amazon compared to other local stores.protects her phone and has saved it a few times from our 3yr old dropping it.
"I got this case after dropping my S4 on the asphalt and shattering the glass, because the case I had previously didn't protect the corners very well.  So after getting another S4, I decided to purchase this case to protect it from happening to me again.  I can say the case does protect my phone well.  I had my first incident where the protective factor was tested the other day in a parking lot.  I dropped my phone out of my shirt pocket and it went straight to the asphalt.  I gasped, but when I picked it up, the phone was completely fine.  I'm not certain, but I think the case's weight flipped the phone around so it didn't land on the screen side.  I recommend this case to protect your S4.  About it being slippery, I see what people say about the back, but that's not too much of a problem, just need to be aware when placing on certain surfaces that it might slide."
"Bought this for my wife. Put iphone in case. Then watched wife for months drop, toss, drop then kick, and apparently play hockey with the thing. She is a stuff juggler. Busy and mobile going from place,to place while carrying too much stuff and talking on phone, Bang there it goes again.I'm impressed.Recommended"
"At first I was hesitant in buying the otter box because it made phones so bulky, but now I'm use to it. It is definitely one of the most durable cases I have owned. It reminds me of the old nokia's that were indestructible."
"I received this unit free for review, along with a couple other OXA products, and will say that in general, I am impressed with the quality of the products. Not quite Belkin level (which I adore and trust), but really good.I seem to be forgetful about charging things lately, and this has been great for me. If I notice that my phone is about out of charge as I'm heading out the door, I can grab this, too. The more obvious use is for travel, when it's not an issue of forgetfulness, but perhaps a long day without an easy way to get to a wall socket.Pros:1. 3000mAh size will get me through a phone charge and a little bit more, which will get me through a long day or just help me out if I forgot to charge my phone the day before.2. Slim size means it's easy to take in my purse3. The included charging cables have multiple different tips.4. Nice looking sleek unitCons:1. The cables are very clever, but somewhat clunky and not as sleek as the battery itself.This is my second favorite external battery (second only to the 8000mAh OXA), but I'm giving it four stars because of the clunky cables and similarly not polished instructions.Note: I was sent a sample product to review, but this did not come with an obligation or expectation of a positive review. This review is genuine."
"have purchased four and all of them stop working they spit at the end of the cord,one the plug can apart"
"This is a one time tool! It wears and breaks after using it only one time. That should come with it because it's made of plastic so what can you expect? For the price, I wouldn't really recommend or buy it again."
"The Note II is giant, so I wanted some protection for my Note II without a lot of bulk. This cover does just that. However, I WISH they'd offer a &#34;US&#34; version with all four corners covered, as opposed to assuming the int'l version with one corner used for a lanyard anchor. So one corner will be exposed to bumps. And then there's the sticker they put on the back of the inside, which is ugly. Word to the wise - leave it. If you try to peel it off you will learn the sticker is stuck on with a less than friendly glue and will shred and leave the back super sticky. Ugh!"
"Terrific unit, slim and grips well to my car visor and easy to pair/connect to my phone.  FM transmitter allows songs, GPS and conversations to be heard through my car stereo.  No complaints from folks on the other end.  Easy to use, good quality sound.  A little pricey, since the Plantronics K100 is cheaper and reviews rate it just as nice.  Considered the BlueAnt S4 because of easy voice control, but no FM transmitter on that one.  Wish this one was cheaper, but no complaints of any kind.  Does a good job."
very good feel to it with the matte finishdoes not add much volume to phonefits perfect and all buttons work effortlesslylike them and highly recommend
I bought the lace and pearl hard case cover for my wife and she loved it. She uses it occasionally as it is meant for special occasions. She has another case for daily use. Whenever she is out for any important function she makes it a point to change the case. The lace and the pearl combination is an eye-catcher. My wife is happy with the compliments she is getting these days for her new iPhone case. Infact two of her friends have placed an order for the lace and pearl hand case cover. Use with care to last longer.
"Very nice, good design. They didn't though about the headset plug is covered with the lead, but anyway is ok."
"Red Pocket is an MVNO for AT&T.; You get the same AT&T; network. I had an activation problem that was poorly handled by their customer service. It took multiple phone calls to sort out.I used the service with my iPhone 5 in South Florida. I consistently got 1mbps downloads. That's ok but when TMobile refarmed my area for iPhone compatibility, I switched to PlantinumTel which is an MVNO for TMobile. My iPhone always got 3mbps downloads and sometimes > 12mbps. PlantinumTel was easy to activate over the Internet, cheaper, essentially unlimited everything and is considerably faster. YMMV."
This charger was a great gift i had received. I took this with me to go out hiking and hooked it up to my solar panels and never ran into any issues. All together a great device. My only complaint about the device is that it took a while longer to charge my S4 than most devices.Pros-Drop proof (dropped it from 50ft on accident don't suggest but hey it survived)-Waterproof (kept in the bottom of my kyak still no issues)-great capacity (definitely keeps my phone going another day or two depending on use)-Two usbs one 1.0 amp and one 2 amp (great for people that have multiple devices that require different amps)- great place on the back to tie it down-micro usb chargerCons- Kinda bulky - however needed for strength-takes a while to charge larger capacity devices ex. S4- does not include wall chargerAll in all though if you are an outdoors person this is the battery pack for you.
"The privacy part works for me, works from a 360 degree view. After about 3 months the edges are starting to peal off. Other then that it was good :)"
"There is truth to the claims that this is not the same charger as the one that comes with the iPad. I just got this today and the two units are definitely different...this one is lighter, has different writing on it [the phrase ""Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China"" is missing from this product even though it does say ""(c) 2010 Apple Inc. All rights reserved."" The electrical information appears to be the same.  I note that the male USB receptacle is mounted in this unit the other way around!  There are some other difference too.I haven't had it long enough to see if the charging performance is the same or roughly the same, but I plan to test this over the next few days.  At least my iPad does charge.  Not sure about the rate of charging or if this is a durable product.Comment: I have a charger for my Nook Color that is rated at 5V and 1.9A (or 9.5W).  The iPad will NOT charge at all with this charger, but it does charge with the unit under review here.  Apple has obviously built some smarts into the iPad and has a fairly tight range of voltage/current that it will accept for charging.I have been using this charger for the last 3 nights to recharge my iPad 2. Even though this is not an Apple product, the price is also not an Apple product price, either.  It seems to work fine for charging my iPad. I will continue to post updates on how this charger performs.  And for those who only want the Apple charger, why not order it from Apple or Best Buy? Apple products always seem to come with Apple prices and not discounted (unless Apple has discounted the product themselves (like they did for the 1st gen iPad recently).Edit:  I have now been using this charger for nearly two weeks.  It works fine.  I'm not giving it 5 stars as the product wording does lead one to believe it is an Apple product.  But the iPad 2 won't tolerate charges can't can't supply the required 2 A @ 5V. This one does and charges my iPad 2 the same rate as the one that came with my iPad.  It's a good bit cheaper, but it hasn't fallen apart and doesn't over heat.Edit2:  I've been using this charger for several months now. Charges my iPad 2 just fine.  It is clearly not the Apple product, but it puts out 5V @ 2.1A and that's what the iPad 2 needs.Edit3: Well, I decided to put a Kill A Watt meter on this unit to see what wattage is is providing compared to the Apple charger. It turns out it is only putting out 6 Watts according to this meter. However, the Apple charger puts out 11 Watts. Now, this is the measurement according to my Kill A Watt meter.  Apparently, it is giving my iPad 2 what it needs to think this is a compatible charger because the iPad 2 chargers, but obviously it is going to charge the unit at a slower rate.  This is definitely NOT even a 10 Watt charger, let alone an Apple charger. Thus, this is indeed a rip-off device, even though I have used it for months to charge my iPad 2.I just noticed that the price of this item has increased, too.  I'm going to write Amazon about this.Edit4: While the product may not be up to par, the seller is apparently of a much higher order.  I was refunded my purchase price for this product.  In the future, I will continue to buy from this seller and they do stand behind what they sell. Also, they did offer to test another unit and send it out to me."
"Battery packs are hard to differentiate, but I can tell you that my time with this one has impressed me more than most.  The aluminum body is attractive and durable, with the only flaw being that the power button is a bit too recessed.  However, that does prevent accidental presses.  More importantly, the battery charges well, does not drain too quickly when not in use, and has an ample power reserve for any normal use.  I had it charging a phone, tablet, and bluetooth speaker under moderate to heavy use for days with less than half of the battery used!There is a place for the tiny power packs, such as those that fit into phone cases.  However, if you are looking for a pack that will keep your devices charged for long periods away from wall sockets, this is a good option.Thank you to the company for the review unit."
"this is your standard screen cover; easy to place on your iphone or ipod, and it takes a lot to scratch it. i always get one for my iphone when i get a new one because if the screen gets scratch you phone looks awful.belkin products are always good, i would recommend this product."
Very pretty! and its detail ppl always ask about this case it stands out. Love the stones and it come with extras very cool case so glad I purchase :)
This is a great LOD for iPhone 4s and FiOO e11. I deducted one star because you have to do some twisting in order to bound an iPhone 4s and FiOO e11 together when this LOD cable is attached.
"I didn't like at all how bad it smelled. I sprayed it with so much febreeze I swear, but besides that it is super cute and looks adorable. I love this case and would definitely recommend it, but not meant for protecting your phone, look for a different one if that's what you want. But if you just want to dress up your phone then this would be an excellent choice."
If you're like I was trying to choose between this case and the Otterbox commuter case then allow me to persuade you to buy this one.This case is great and you can really tell they put in some time designing it. Your phone really just feels sturdy and protected. Thick rubber on the corners where those screen shattering hits usually land. Hard backing that has added grip that is not only functional but also looks good. Almost identical thickness as the otterbox commuter. Buttons function exactly as they should. Just like pressing the button without a case on the phone. The only thing about the case I'm not thrilled about is the lack of port covers but I knew that went I made the purchase.Let me just say I would way rather do without port covers than to have to continue using that otterbox case. In my opinion the stiff buttons on the otterbox are a design flaw that I couldn't overlook. If you want port covers bad enough to deal with the stiff buttons the otterbox isn't a bad case. For me however it was just horrible.
"Practical and affordable! This case has some design factor but is huge on its practicality, it is slightly rubberized to prevent slipping, its light and its easy to put the cover on.Great basic case with colors! :)"
"I really like the color of this case, it is close to my wedding colors, but the one thing is that I have small hands and with the golssyness of the case it is sometimes hard to keep a firm hand on it."
battery was very handy. fit my phone and keeps better charge. looking for battery is hard but was very pleased with it
These are different in shape and comfort than the original earphones that came with my S4. I do not like these at all since the plastic is not as thick on these like the genuine Samsung are
"Not particularly loud- I use it on airplanes and have to turn my sound all the way up. If I push the headphone deeper into my ear, it is loud. As it is, the sound is adequate. Fits well, works fine.Biggest drawback- No Manual! Even finding directions online is difficult. Pairing takes a bit of doing, but ultimately, hold the phone button till the lights flash blue and red. I have had to re-pair it to my iPad a couple of times- it is in the device list but won't connect. I &#34;forget&#34; the device and re- connect and it works well. Sound quality is what you would expect for a bluetooth device. There are no volume keys for listening to music- pushing the + or - key advances the music forward or back, it doesn't turn the volume up. You can only do that on the device."
"I am thrilled with these headphones! They paired perfectly with my Droid phone and I started listening immediately. I was blown away with the quality of sound, comfort of the earbuds and the wireless capability.The sound is really incredible. Probably the best I've heard from small earbuds. There are controls on a very small black rubber inline strip located on the cord. Pause, forward, backward, volume + -, and call answer.The charging system is an incredible feat of engineering and involves a little clip that slides along the cord and clips down on one of the bud heads where two very small contact points are positioned. It takes a couple of hours to charge and there is an indicator light to let you know if they are still charging or all done.A very comfortable silicone cord that is just long enough to connect the earbuds and short enough to not get in the way especially when tucked behind your head.It comes with three sizes of rubber tips and two sets of bud positioning tabs that help to hold them in for more vigorous activity. I haven't quite figured out the positioning of these but the earbuds stay in for me so it's not an issue.I used them while mowing the lawn. They helped to cut out the noise and stayed clear and connected for the most part. They occasionally cut out for a fraction of a second. They stayed put and never fell out. Depending on your sound source, they do cut in and out during general use but it was usually when I was moving around a lot. It gets a little annoying at times but I still love to use them.I love the cord free bluetooth ability. I've had too many cords pull out quickly from my phone while doing activities.Highly recommended!!I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review."
"This speaker is super cheap and super loud!  Only use it in the shower though because the sound quality is bad unless you use it in there. I feel like they designed it to sound good in a shower. You can answer calls on it, too! I've only charged it once so far and used it several times! It hasn't fallen off my wall. My only complaints are that it's annoying when the volume and skip song controlls are the same buttons because it's hard to change the volume by a small amount without accidentally changing the song. Next, the speaker makes a really loud chime when you turn it on and off, regardless of the song volume you set. Lastly, the little cover for the place where you charge it is kind of flimsy and falling off and it worries me that water will get in there and break it. I haven't had any problems yet, though."
I got my order almost immedietly! Its the perfect fit and its exactly what i ordered I couldnt be any happier :-)
"I have this case in four different colors. I love this case. An affordable way to add color to your day when you use your phone. I aam hoping to finish my collection by purchasing all of the color options. What you see is what you get. I was lucky enought to get this a few days before the time frame, I plan to be buying more products from this user in the future.I purchased this for a Sprint iPhone 4s. It fits perfectly."
This is the first dash mount that I've purchased and my wife and I are very happy with it. I use it for my Galaxy SIII and it works really well.Pros- Very adjustable- Feels very sturdy; Doesn't feel cheap or built with poor materials- The center button which latches is very responsive- Suctions very well onto the windshield- Firm gripCon- Not a huge fan of the center button; Takes a couple tries to figure best approach to insert/withdraw
This case is nice case it's well built and holdsThe phone like glove it has stylist and good cover this is well built case for the note 3If you want safety this is the case to have
"I've had my case for a few weeks now. I'm not very gentle with my phone (Droid x2), Ill throw it in the purse, on a chair, it falls etc. The case is made of 2 parts: front plate and back plate and they snap together. The ""suture"" line doesn't bother me and the parts have never popped off accidentally. The case feels very sturdy and hard yet it's not bulky. I love the rounded corners and the material feels like a plastic-y suede (not sure how else to describe it). The color is not as bright as in the picture (electric blue). It's more of a ultramarine blue but I like it. The holes for the speakers and buttons are cut well. I have to slightly push down harder on the volume buttons since the case edges for that cut out are a little deeper but it's also not a problem for me."
"Using this to car charge a Samsung Galaxy S4. I watched the charging current and rate of charge very carefully (as I have several chargers that make claims about high current or &#34;fast&#34; charging that simply don't do anything near what they claim.This one, apparently does. I checked time to charge and the measured charging rate. The results were consistent, i.e., the time it took to charge the battery was consistent with the current being shown by my meter and claimed output current of this charger. I measured 1900 mA, and this charger is rated at 2000 mA (2 amps).The price is right, the current is right and the convenience is a plus (having a dedicated micro-usb cable as well as a 2nd port for USB charging connections.I now have been very pleased by two Anker products: a dual battery and home charger kit, and this car charger.Both of the batteries charge and hold charge properly, the home charger works just fine, with color coded lights for &#34;charging&#34; and &#34;charged&#34;.This charger has NO lights, not even one to show that it is plugged in and receiving power. No biggie. The charger does exactly what it claims. If it lasts it will have been a great investment."
"Very nice color, just as seen on the picture. It fits perfectly, it gives a fine grasp on the phone and colors it up!"
"I received (3) screen protectors from Anker as a promotion for offering my UNBIASED review. I will start by saying that I normally do not use plastic screen protectors on my devices cause I have come to really like tempered glass screen protectors for their ability to ""feel"" like real glass and also prevent screen breakage. The only problem with some of the tempered glass screen protectors out there is that they are very thick and add an ugly layer that just does not look right. I decided that I will just go back to the good ol' plastic ones and I was pleasantly surprised by how well these fit my Galaxy S5. The packaging was top notch and included the (3) screen protectors, dust tape and a microfiber cloth. The screen protectors were also protected by a hard paper insert so that the protectors do not get damaged in shipping and that used to be a big issue in the past as I have received many damaged protectors due to the mail man bending them or just damage from handling. I usually get a perfect application by the 2nd screen protector applied, but I had great luck with the fit of the Anker protectors and got it right on my first try and it left ZERO bubbles! I did get a piece of dust trapped underneath but that was easily fixed by using the supplied ""dust tape"" and lifting the protector and re-applying it. The clarity of these are excellent and they feel pretty natural to the touch. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to protect their screen on the S5 and applaud Anker for producing a great quality product. They have never disappointed me! Feel free to ask any questions and I may be able to be of assistance before purchase. I also left a picture so that you can see the applied screen protectir and what the package comes with. Thumbs UP!"
"This came in the same box as my new phone. I actually put it on before I even activated the phone. It was super easy to put on, fits very well, has a nice textured grip on the sides, design on the back looks cool, although it is more translucent than I thought it would be. I think it would better in black. But a really good product, for the money a great product."
Got 2 of these cases for my husband. The price is fabulous for the quality. He usually uses $30+ cases but decided to give this a try because of the stand. He was able to stand the phone up and study without worrying about the phone sliding down. Does provide a decent amount of protection if dropped.
"Out of the box I really liked this charger.  The plug rotates, so that it can fit easily on any power strip, the glossy white design is nice.  It runs a bit hot when charging, but not distressingly so.  There is one disappointing drawback.  The USB connector is a bit off, so that it does not always make a good connection to my iPad.  The connection is also a bit loose, which means that by moving the cord while charging, you can easily disconnect without realizing it.  There have been several occasions when I left my iPad plugged in to charge, but the cable shifted, and the device was not charged when I retrieved it.  Also, the cord itself is rather stiff, so that touching the cord gently at almost any point is often enough to halt the charging process.  So, although it charges my device sometimes, this charger is not as reliable as most of the other ones I use."
"Though the price is low, I did not like it. The pack doesn't contain any micro fiber filter to clean the screen. Also when i put on this protector, cudnt do it to perfection which has resulted in bubbles in between."
This case is very sturdy and it's a perfect fit on my iPhone 5. I like the fact that it looks as good as an Otterbox case without me having to pay the Otterbox price lol. Would recommend this case.
"Was afraid the clip on his Verizon case would break, causing him to lose his newest toy.  This meets all requirements, including that the phone fits the holster even with Otterbox Defender case on it."
"been using this case for a few weeks now and let me say that i have owned ALOT of wallet cases for my iPhone 5. Let me list some and why I like this one the most, for now at least. I currently own the Incipio Stashback, the Speck SmartFlex Card, the TwelveSouth BookBook case, the CaseMate Pop ID Case and this one, the Incipio Stowaway. Now I never used any previous models for my iPhone 4 and 4s so I can't really speak on that and speak on if it was different or not. But I can say, out of all the wallet cases i've listed, I like this one ALOT. Between the Speck SmartFlex Card and this one i've been switching back and forth. I like this Stowaway because it is a LITTLE less bulky than the SmartFlex Card case. I like the glossy finish but having a glossy finish also means your case does get scratched up easily and also becomes a finger oil magnet. I swipe this case alot because it gets super oily in the back. Another thing to keep in mind is that the button are VERY hard to press, especially the wake and sleep button. Another thing is that this case does NOT push up on your screen protector if you have any installed on your device. I found that to be an issue with the other case, the Incipio Stashback. This case feels solid and it has a big enough lip to lay your screen down on the table. I have drop my phone a few times off the table or from about a 3 feet distance and the phone and case were intact with no damage whatsoever to the phone nor the case itself. As for the cards, it only fits 3 of my cards. 1 California ID card, 1 Costco membership card and 1 debit card. Unlike the Speck Smartflex which can fit up to 4 cards. But it just depends on the person buying the case. I personally love it, for now at least. I've heard customers complaining about the door of the case and card giving out after time and if it does i will update my review! Also, it comes with screen protectors for the front and back."
"While the extra pocket might seem handy, I can keep everything else in my wallet. What I wanted, was a holder that wouldn't fall off my belt. This one has belt loops; but the Case Mate one has a clip that is so strong it stays put too, and that one has a more sturdy case, a phone cover, and a free screen protector. Case mate is better."
"This is simple, soft  color, covers my phone well! Does not make my phone look bulky which I love. Does get stained though."
"This is an amazing deal for a micro-USB cord and charger.  As others have said, the cord is short, but I really dont want a long charging cable.  I charge all my devices on a table with a power strip on it, so everything rests next to the power strip while charging.I have successfully used this charger on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, HTC T-Mobile G2, and a Droid Charge.  I cant imagine this not working on any micro-USB phone.You cant go wrong for something that has a name brand on it, does what its supposed to, and only costs a couple of bucks!"
"Had no problem at all putting it on. I cleaned the phone very, very well. I did read in one review to place the screen guard on side to side instead of top to bottom, I worked perfectly. I had ONE small bubble at the very corner and it came out with no problem. Can't really tell there is a screen guard on the phone. No problem when using the phone. My finger slides across just like the bare screen I will defiantly buy again."
"I Received this case and the fit is perfect.  It has maintained the thin profile that goes along with the newest iphone.  For $3, this was a great value and has given me a nice change of case for my iphone.  For someone who wants to protect the screen, have a minimal case, and carry ID and a credit card, this is perfect.  They include a nice clip on strap, but be prepared to supply a connector that will slip into the hang ring because the clip doesn't really fit thru the hole.There are more protective cases out there, but for the price, this one was really good. It provides some protection, a small wallet portion- don't expect to carry more than 2 cards and a little cash, but for running to the store, it's a quick grab and go.  I have other wallet cases that hold many more cards and cash, but that adds extra bulk to the case that this one does not have.  It maintains the thin profile of the phone.The one con I have is the materials.  Don't expect nice leather for $3.  For what it is, it is fine.  The workmanship is good, but it is Pleather or plastic.  No unpleasant odor, the cut outs are perfect, and the color blocking is very modern and brite.Would love to see what they would do with quality materials!"
I love this case because it was rubberized and it had a really nice color of purple in it. Pretty easy to take off.
this case is okay i can't use it because it won't fit with any of my chargers it like blocks the charger port.
"Bought this as replacement for my lost iPhone 3GS cord.It's the generic version and works just as good as the Apple one, but costs way less. Therefore, I recommend it."
"Cheaper than buying a new case.  Works as well as original.  Unless the rubber case on outside of phone is loose, this is cheaper alternative"
"this works great with my Iphone 4Stakes great pictures, lil hassel to set up but it is great purchase and have talked others into buying as well"
Fits snug. All claims appear true.
I purchased this for a tablet made by another company~Its as good as most films out there~My best advice on screen protectors for tablets~make sure you get the right size for the actual tablet you own~they all have different places of camera position~Follow the directions to the letter this size film can be tricky.
Significantly too small. I asked for a protective case for a Samsung Galaxy 2 from T-mobile and that is not what I got.
"After ordering less expensive phone protection shields,these cannot compare!! Goes on easily with NO bubbles to try and push out. Shipped as stated. Ordered these for myself, my boyfriend and my sister. Also they fit screen as promised."
"For references, I tested this headset with an iPhone 5s and a 2012 iMac.First impressions of this headset aren't great. Sure, it's not a particularly expensive set, but it feels cheap, plastic, and altogether not very premium in any way...Pairing the headset was simple. Hold down the Bluetooth button for about five seconds or so, until the light flashes red/blue alternately. The device shows up as ""LD-9210"" on your computer/phone, and pairing did not require a passcode.When wearing it, it's actually not uncomfortable, with adjustable sides and soft pads for your ears.Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. I immediately noticed an electronic buzzing/squealing sound coming from the right earphone side. As soon as you'd stop playing any content/music etc over Bluetooth, the squeal/buzz would disappear. But then when you start your music etc again, the noise comes back. It's really unpleasant. This happened with both my phone and my computer, ruling out any hardware issue on my end.Unfortunately, this tainted the use of the headset so much so that even though the rest of the sound quality was passable, I simply couldn't wear them for any period of time due to the buzzing.Overall 2 out of 5. Very disappointing."
"It is a nice phone. It picked up my T Mobile card right away with no problem. The internet does work a little slow which can be a little frustrating, but its because it works off of 2g. Picks up my WiFi pretty good so I use that when I am at home when I want to surf the web. When texting, you need to include area code for it to send the message which is no biggie. The camera is good. As far as phone calls, works great.My only issue would be the fact of only being 2g. Other than that, great phone. Did not want to spend so much on a phone when they always come out with another one almost every year and ask for so much to have it. I am fine with this one."
"I had this same case on my Galaxy Nexus and it was a 5 star. I ordered it for my new Nexus 4 and was disappointed. First of all, the power and volume buttons are hard to push. In the other one, there was no noticeable difference, in this one, I have to make a conscious effort to push harder to wake the phone. Secondly, the cutout for the usb cable is too small and the cable I use for my car charger will not go all the way in. This is the same cable I used on the same case on my other phone. I could get a new charger, but why do I have to, and what other cable that I might need will not fit as well. I don't know if I got a lemon or not, as everyone seems to love this case. PS, this case works great on the Zens wireless charger."
"I put this on a black Razr M, and it transformed the looks of the phone from nice to beautiful. The fit, and finish are top notch. It may not have been expensive, but it's definitely a quality item.I'm very impressed with the raised areas. They're finished perfectly, and make the phone much easier to hold on to. I'm very pleased with the purchase. With the protective case I had on it, it was big and bulky. The Cimo turned it back into a sleek phone.My girlfriend likes it so much she wants me to get a couple for her iPhone. She loved the way it changed the look of the phone, and is glad I got rid of the ""otherbox"" that was on it."
"We used this while traveling on vacation with our Motorola Defy smartphones.  These phones seem to drain the battery quickly when using 3G data, they won't make it through the day.  We were using 3G data a lot as we walked to see the sights in a city each day, enabling GPS to map out which way to walk to the next museum or landmark.  This Duracell backup battery came in very handy because we didn't stop long enough to charge our phones into a wall plug, we were always moving, moving, moving (and we didn't have a rental car, so we couldn't plug a phone into a car charger either).  With this backup battery, it fit in my purse and I could plug a phone in that was running out of juice, and we'd keep on walking.  Very happy with it, I'm so glad I had it because even with trying to only use one phone at a time to try to save battery, the batteries would've been dead without this Duracell backup battery."
"the clips on the edges do not fit, do not clip, it falls apart. Worthless purchase. Wouldn't even bother to buy if I knew"
Purchased this for my fianc&eacute; and she loves it. Doesn't add as much bulk compares to her previous case but it still protects. Came with screen protector and love how it shows the back part of phone and can put a picture or design.
"Works well, fits well, and recommend if you like the color orange as in CONSTRUCTION SITE orange.  It's always hard to select colors on line, but I took a chance. Not the color I was hoping for, but overall the construction of the phone cover is solid, fits well, and worth the money.  I cannot give it a low score due to color as it is what it is."
"This case it super hard to pull apart. With or without the phone inside. When taking a picture, everything was pink! I don't really recommend this case if you use a lot of flash."
Waaaay cheaper than the store version and works great! Even works for my ipad that requires more power in order to charge appropriately!
I understand that this item was only $2. But I ordered it on December 2 and it is now January 14! If I had any idea it would take this long I would have never considered it. I ordered it for a trip I was taking a few weeks ago and am glad I didn't have my hopes too high. This waiting period is crazy! Who has to wait this long for something so small? This is truly the longest I've had to wait out of the dozens of things I've ordered off of Amazon. Truly displeased.
It pretty much has every thing you may need to hang your phone in different places in your car. I only wish it wasn't as expensive.
it was a bit stretched out for my phone. I think the material wasn't as strong as I wanted to phone case to be. overall its ok.
Amazing amount of Battery life on this one! you will not be disappointed.  Charges fast!
"--UPDATES: well, these lasted less than two months.  First one of the inserts got lost.  It fell off easily, so it was bound to happen.  Second, the connector sleeve fell apart.  It just came off, and disconnected.  I glued it back, and it worked for a while.  But now, it simply has no sound.  This is terrible quality.  It's not worth 1/10 of the price.Unfortunately, I liked its design a lot.  The following is the original review:The angled design is not a gimmick.  It is an essential feature of these earphones to make them stay securely and comfortably in your ears.The acoustic insulation is modest, which to me is a good thing. Some complain that the phones don't go as deep in the ears as they want for better insulation. But one should be aware that plugging earphones very deep in your ears comes with prices: (1) they harm your hearing if you use them too much, which is physically unhealthy; (2) they make you too much ""devoted"" to whatever you're listening, a kind of devotion that requires isolation, which is socially unhealthy; and (3) with your ears blocked, they inherently make telephone conversations very uncomfortable because of an unnatural interference between you own voice and the other caller's voice.  All these detriments for better sound.  I say no to that.  So it is a personal choice.  To my own taste, these earphones already stay a little bit too deep in the ear, so I'm glad that they don't go even deeper and tighter.  But I'm glad that they're secure and comfortableThe microphone works, and so far no one has complained when I make calls.  But these ""in-ear"" phones are a bad choice for making calls, because they all feel very unnatural and uncomfortable when you speak with your ears plugged.  Both you and the other caller would sound strange, and your ears feel uncomfortable (sort of like how you feel if you talk during landing of an airplane). But this problem is not unique to these headphones. They are universal for this type of designs, which are primarily for a listening experience, not for a conversing experience.Cannot comment on its durability."
"I love this one, my favorite color, it fits snug all over. I did think it was a little darker but it's fine."
"Having purchased a number of 3rd party chargers through the years, I was somewhat skeptical, but hopeful on buying this unit. Others from different providers had issues with bulky size, prongs that don't fold for travel, or just plain falling apart. And that doesn't count the units that won't work with a Blackberry Bold, an LG dumb phone, or an iPad.I am happy to report that this one has an excellent build quality. It feels solid, and it works with all my assorted electronics so far. BB Bold 9930, iPad 3, Samsung Androids, LG, and iPhone 4 and 5 are all supported.Great Product! I purchased a second one after my evaluation."
had the battery for a month with no problems. but it ended up dying. i charged it and it didnt hold any charge non of the little lights came on. had to go return. besides that when getting this product it did feel a little cheap and light like i could push my thumb threw the thin plastic top. not sure if it would have survived a year anyways
"Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves it as it's very compact and fits in her handbag quite unobtrusively, while keeping her iPhone charged at all times."
It works as designed. The flaw is not with the product but with my memory to check to see that it is fully charged. It is easy to charge up by plugging it in to your computer via the iPhone charging cord.
"I love this device. Every car should have one. Fits just fine in my 2005 Honda Accord Hybrid in the console. Not too obtrusive, charges two devices at once, even the power-hungry iPad!"
"I have not received this case as yet but I am guessing tommrow. I have bought a lot of cell phone cases from Amazon and love everyone. I always get positive feed back from all my friends, and when they ask where I bought it I tell them Amazon!!!! Best place in the world to buy anything."
"Product came in fast. Don't peel on the edges, stays in place and easy to take off when it's time to change it out."
"I have purchased many replacement batteries for my S3. I takel a lot of pictures and video and prefer to swap fresh batteries. No need to carry a wall charger and search for power source. I use external batteries also.This battery lasts just as long as my original battery. Other brands do OK. But after a few months, they quickly lose their capacity and only last a few hours.I really like this battery! I will buy a few more."
I like this product and was actually surprised that it will charge my phone even when the car is off as a lot of car phone chargers do not have that feature. Only downside is that it takes a long time to fully charge the phone. Good product for the price.
"This is a great value for the money.  I love that they pop into the headphone jack.  I use them for my ipod, my phone, and my Kindle Fire.  They are durable and function perfectly."
The bottom left corner was broken when i got it in the mail but then they said that they would send me a new one and i got it recently and i completly love it. They were so nice and i am defenetly getting more things fromm them :)
"Its rogh or good for protecting your iphone, obviously a little big, but has excellent quality and give goog gap"
got this as a backup for my car. It works just fine. only complaint is that it would charge my fone faster.
I love that I am now able to use my personal headphones to listen to music on my phone. This audio adapter is perfect to use with FM transmitters in vehicles as well. Great item to have with a mobile device!
I opened the box and an odor hit me like a hammer. I think it was the plastic smell or something but it was horrible.Pros:Sticks to any surfacePerfect fit for phones and some small devicesLooks pretty good on the dash of my carDoes the job at holding your phone just tight enoughCons:Smells weird
Good value for the price. Easy to install protection for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. Like the antiglare screen for book reading.
The case was good at first. But then the plastic on the inside part of the case cracked after having it for a few days. But I didn't pay much a all for the case.
Only negative thing that could be said it that there is no markings on it which helps identify which side goes up or down. I feel this to be a minor issue. Transfer and charging rates are equal to OEM for a fraction of the price. It's a win.
this cover is the best i've used so far..protects the phone and is easy to use the buttons on the phone.
"I dropped my phone on the sidewalk and it landed on the bottom of the case. The phone was playing a song, and when I picked it up noticed the phone didn't even switch off. Also, the rubber bottom is thick and I merely wiped off a small amount of dust, and it was like new. The designer of this cover was very clever with the face. The phone isn't protected in the front, but if you drop in on the face, the edges of the cover actually sticks out a fraction above the surface level of the glass. Therefore if the phone falls on it's face and scrapes the ground, this case will bear the brunt of the impact. Although it comes with a free clear plastic screen protector, I prefer the glossy glass.I do give this one point off from a perfect score because it doesn't sit flat on a table. But it comes out of the case so easily it is really easy just to use it on the go. It takes as much time to secure the phone in the case as it takes to pick up your keys off of the table."
Stay away from this product and anything they sell Spigen SGP is one big scam. If you want quality buy otterbox.Scam artists
"I will never find a pouch that is perfect for my needs.  They either have too many pockets or not enough. Or the pockets are too big or too small.  The construction is great, just doesn't fit my needs.  I'm sure it will fit someone else's need perfectly"
"Ok to start off I couldn't wait to buy this guy online so I rushed out to Beast Buy and picked it up.  I have owned a first gen jawbone and the jawbone II as well... The jawbone II suffered ear barrel breakage... Did I mention I'm death on a headset?  Well the first 4 days with icon were bluetooth bliss... No more wind noise, no more anything... Way better noise assassin than that of the jawbone 2 or the prime.  I only compare this jawbone to other jawbones... simply because there is no other headset to compare a jawbone to... they are that good.  So alas I was shoveling snow and noticed my headset was not in my ear.  OMG it was brand new.  Well it lost connection to my phone and I started like a mad man raking through 16 inches of snow I had piled up into 3-5 foot tall hills... No luck :(  So I tried again for 3 days and it kept snowing so it was hopeless... My jawbone was in a snowy grave... I then bought another one just because they are that good.  Well today the temp was 62 degrees and all the snow melted.  Low and behold I found my fallen jawbone at the edge of my yard.  This is hopeless right?  WRONG!!!  It charged right up and paired perfectly with my wife's phone.  Now she too has a jawbone icon.. If that isn't the testament to the best bluetooth in the world you tell me what is?  I could talk about how it fits and how awesome the call quality is and the battery life, etc... but hey if you are looking here you know what you are looking at.  These bluetooth headsets are very comfortable and come with many ways to customize it.  The on of switch and sensibly placed button are improvements over recent models.  I still think a jabra mini gel ear bud is better than the included gels; but to each his own.  All I'm saying is; unless you physically break the thing; the electronics will NEVER FAIL!!!  Kudos Aliph on another stellar product."
I ordered this case for my boss and he loved it! very durable case and the kickstand works great!! awesone!
"Like all screen protectors, can be tricky to install.  Nevertheless, good quality and outstanding customer support.  They respond to email inquiries immediately and politely."
"I like this bumper and prefer them to full coverage covers because it DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH PHOTO TAKING. It seems like it would protect better than the Apple bumper I purchased previously.  I like the color and the feel of it very much so I purchased three: blue, pink and purple."
"I opted for the 4400 mAh battery that comes with the extended battery cover, and at first I wasn't sure I liked it. But once I charged it up and used it I was hooked.I can now go a whole day without having to be tethered to a USB charger! I just leave bluetooth/wifi/gps, everything enabled and it takes everything I throw at it and barely gets drained.Sure, it makes the phone a bit thicker, but I actually like that it makes it easier to hold on to.Overall a definite recommendation if you own an S3."
"I just put this on my phone 2 seconds ago. and It's absolutely perfect. It adds very little to the actual phone as far as size, but should provide adequate protection for minor falls that you experience in life. The chrome buttons are perfect for the phone. Provide no loss of ability to use the buttons. Cutouts are precisely located and look good on the phone. TPU is a little bit more slippery then I was expecting, but is still the best case I've seen for a GS4."
Super cheap. Good price spent on something to protect my phone. Very nicely priced too that I can replace it (if needed) at a reasonable rate.
"I like this headset because it's well built, has a standard charging port, fits comfortably, and lasts a long time on one charge.  Since my hearing isn't so great, I find it to be a little bit quiet for use in the car.  Instead, I use it around the apartment and its fine for that.  overall a great product for the price."
GOT THE CASE FOR MY SON PHONE HE LOVES IT EASY TO PUT ON BUT HARD TO TAKE OFF. HE LOVES BLUE SO THIS WAS PERFECT
love the color and kids loved the extra colorful charging cords.  everyone wanted to buy them from my son at school.
Great Screen protectors for the price and they stick really well to the screen and also can easy peel them off to make adjustments without causing any creases in the film . really satisfied with this product and would also buy again in the future.
"I bought this for my boyfriend since he's become quite active and started to run a lot. I've been trying to find a very good one. I was tired of buying the mid prices of 15.00 since they become warn out after 2 weeks. Luckily, I came across this and I am very pleased that I decided to buy this instead of the cheap ones.It's a snuggle fit for an iPhone 5 (though, it could work for a iPhone 4, but the holes where you insert your headphones are at  different places so technically it be to your liking). The material is a very comfortable rubber, and the waist band is easily adjustable. My boyfriend was very amazed and he loves it."
"I'm assuming that this is the same company that makes the Book Book. I rated that poorly when I played with that at a Barnes and Noble. This is VERY nice. Quality of this in the Brown suede is far better then most IPHONE wallets. The tolerances to the fit of the leather are really excellent. Does NOT appear to be Chinese made like all the other junk. For the price this appears to be a steal. The ONLY thing I would probably change is that there is no closure, snap, or band of any kind to hold this closed. Just as a book would be. So if you fill this with many cards and cash as I do it will be somewhat open which isn't necessarily a bad thing but if your anal like me it irks me a little. I have 5 cards, my license, a work schedule folded up, and 2 bills. The actual fit of the IPhone 5 is virtually perfect. You can't NOT like this so other then the lack of a snap closure this is a truly nice work of art. PS> I just want to ad that this IS LEATHER. The smell is a treatment but it is clearly leather as other people seem to think it isn't. A bargain. Love it.EDIT. A month after carrying this the slots that fit the credit cards tore apart. It looks great but unfortunately it lasted about 4 weeks before splitting apart."
"I received this item via the manufacturer for review.  I can honestly say that after 4 weeks of trials, I am now using the Eachine Orange full time and have retired my other devices.This device has all the power I ever need.  However, for me, its beauty lies in three areas.1. Great color that sets it apart from most external batteries.2. Simple.  Not a lot of bells and horns.  Just does best what it is designed to do.3. Ultra slim. I often carry my cell in my left pocket and my Eachine Orange in my right and never notice either one.There are all shapes and forms of external batteries on the market. I honest say this is one of the best.  I just love it.Highly recommended.Michael L. Gooch"
Great case!!  I've really been enjoying it.  The color is beautiful!!!  I had a few issues and Thierry xiatwr support was amazing!'n
"IMPORTANT:  See comments following this review for more info.=====================================I was so bummed when I dropped my 3GS.  It took about two months for the display to become completely unusable.  It was really disappointing.  I had it in a decentIncipiocase, with a silicone inside and hard plastic protecting the back and the corners.  It just wasn't enough protection though--not even for the ~15"" drop.So in picking out a case for my replacement iPhone 4, I went with something even more solid.  I'm very happy with this Otterbox case, despite some of the flaws.Let's start with the flaws, so I can get my whining out of the way:* The hole for the headphone jack hole is in the wrong spot.  That's pretty sorry Quality Assurance, if you ask me.  Someone should have checked that closer. (NOTE:  See ""Edit"" at the end of this review for an update on this issue.)* Lame instructions:  Installing this case is a little complicated--definitely not self-explanatory. There are installation instructions printed on the inside of the back of the box.  They're really hard to see, so I cut open my box to get a better look.  The instructions are line-art diagrams and aren't that easy to interpret.  I visited the URL printed beneath the instructions, but got a 404 error (yes, I typed it correctly).  I finally found the instructions page on their website, which is a link to a Youtube video.  I guess that's OK, because even if I weren't at my PC I could still get to Youtube on my iPhone.  Still, it seemed like a lot of steps to get to the help I needed.* The case & holster add a lot of bulk to the phone, but I'm willing to live with the bulk to keep my phone safe.OK.  I'm done whining now.I actually really like this case.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the reasons noted above.  The pluses far outweigh the minuses though.  This case (especially this color combo) is very nice looking.  I picked the white & black combo for the Storm Trooper look (nerd alert!).  It really looks nice.  And aside from the misplaced headphone jack hole, the fit & finish are astounding.  The device snaps snugly into the two hard plastic clamshell pieces. The plastic pieces include contours, tabs, and slots for the silicone case to fit into.  The result is very nice.Inside the plastic case there is also a clear plastic cover that fits over the screen.  It fits perfectly and doesn't impede the use of the touch screen much at all.  I had to get used to the extra pressure needed to get through the clear plastic cover, but that didn't take long.Also included is a hard plastic holster.  I'm not sure I'm in love with the holster, but time will tell.  It adds more to the bulk of the device, but it's also very handy.  The clip for the holster also snaps open and rotates so you can use it as a stand.  That's nice if you use your phone as an alarm clock or if you want to watch videos on a flight.Bottom Line:  If you're paranoid about protecting your iPhone device and you don't mind the extra bulk, this is a great case for you.  Browse the different color choices to find one that fits your style.EDIT (1/12/11):  I contacted Otterbox support to ask them if they were aware of the mis-aligned hole for the headphone jack.  They responded to me and told me that this is by design.  The hole isn't supposed to be for a headphone plug; the hole is there for the iPhone 4's noise dampening microphone.  They said that the headphone jack is intentionally covered and that I should open the little flap to plug in my headphones.  Fair enough.  Seems like a weird design to me, but I get it now."
I have a model S10 and it is uncomfortable and this S11-Flex is perfect fit.Bluetooth connection easy I have 3 devices connected too and they all turn on and S11 automaticly connect.The Audio is good not best but good.Price could be lower but it is so new to drop price.
"AS SAID IN MY PREVIOUS RECIEWS IF ELAGO CASES.....YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THEM, THEY ARE THE BEST OUT THERE!"
"Although it's a cute case, the pink stripe groove thing, or whatever you wanna call it, just randomly fell off of the middle. Although I can easily put it back on, I found that weird."
"Didn't have any problems with this charger. It is durable, and does the job. No problems on my end! !"
"This is a good phone mount.  It will hold your phone very securely without any risk of scratching it, yet it's very easy to take your phone out.  However, the only mount method it offers is to your windshield.  Previously, I used a very similar product that I was happy with,Arkon Car Mount Holder.  In addition to mounting on the windshield, the Arkon comes with an adhesive-backed disk you can attach to your dash (and then the suction cup grips onto that), and it even comes with clips for mounting your phone on the louvers of the AC.  Given that versatility, I have to recommend the Arkon over this Panavise."
"I have always been a huge Nokia fan but bailed in favor of android devices a while back. I couldn't resist giving the N8 a shot to see what advances Symbian 3 had made. All I can say is it hasn't come very far. When you are used to the blinding speed of advancement in the android space its hard to imagine how Nokia are going to stay relevant.This is amazing piece of hardware, but how frustrating it is to be back on symbian. I dont even know where to start suffice to say that I am back on android after only a few days with N8. I was very disappointed as I had high hopes.N8 Pro:Excellent battery lifeBest camera of any phoneFinally has threaded texting (as long as it took isnt a good sign for Nokia)N8 cons:Not many prosKeyboard sucksBrowser sucksExchange client sucksStill cant type direct in a text boxLimited widgetsLimited appsSluggish UINo wifi tetherSmallish screen for size of deviceAmoled screen isnt even close to vibrantIf maemo and symbian 3 are the best Nokia can offer I would think they would be best off to leave symbian 3 on their feature phones and adopt android for smartphones. Android is a tidal wave they just arent going to be able to stand in front of. Unless you are a huge symbian fan or have apps that only run on symbian then give this one a miss."
"This didn't cost much, but you get what you pay for. The corner broke off of the case after only a few weeks and we had to pitch it."
"It's only been one day of full use, but the battery has kept up with power throughout the day. So far I am happy :)"
"Pros:Looks good, feels good, it actually does not pain / feel terrible even after wearing over extended hours.Crystal clear sound, dampens the sorrounding noiseCons:Totally unreliable.Just stopped pairing with my phone, without any rhyme nor reason.Got a replacement with the first defunct, the same thing happened with the replacement.Guess, there's something considerably wrong with the product, or I was just plain simply unlucky.Did not expect this unreliable product to come from the stables of the organization which founded the 6 sigma methodology of reducing variations and defects.Anyways, Iam getting a refund, and thankfully, this happened within my first 30 days, so , did not lose my money.Will have to resort to my not so fancy plantronics headset!!!"

"After 2 weeks I started getting an error message on both my iPhone and iPad that the cable is not approved and may not work properly.  When I flip it, it seems to work.  However, I don't like taking the chance something is not right and in any case the charging symbol does not initiate (whether it actually charges or not I don't know because I take it out).  It wouldn't be that big a deal if both sides were not identical, and I suppose I could just mark one side but it seems doomed to fail so I will return it.  I expected more from Belkin."
Love this case. Looks great on my iphone. Fits great. I love all of the jewels on this case. Great
"Really compact and well functioning charger. Battery holds charge and seems to be close to the capacity they advertise.Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, the built in micro-USB cable it too think to fit past most phone/device cases. That kinda puts a dent on the portability factor.Also, it has no real on/off button. It detects when you plug in the device. But seems to have an issue if the device gets disconnected at the other end of the cable. For example, I used the normal USB port and a magnetic charging cable with my phone. When the magnetic end accidentally disconnects and I reattach it, it doesn't start charging. I had to unplug the cable on the battery pack end and replug it in for it to start charging. Sometimes I even have to unplug and replug the build it cable for the other USB port to start charging.Lastly, the built in USB cable lock in pretty tightly (as in stretch the cable) into the micro USB charging slot. So I'm worried that in the long run it might break more easily due to the stress on the cable. But this part is just a hypothesis, not that I have had it long enough to break.I consider Anker to be a better brand than EasyAcc since the 12000mAh EasyAcc battery pack that I got sometime back hardly charges my Nexus 4 2 times. So, it lost the capacity pretty quickly. But for the portable option, I'm forced to go with this EasyAcc product after returning my Anker Astro Slim3 :(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EK3UHS8"
"Durable cover, works pretty well.  Hard to get off once you get it on (actually tore my camera button off the first time I removed it).  The belt clip on the holster digs into my side a bit, so I don't wear it on my belt much."
